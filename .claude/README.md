# Claude Code Skills for AgentPay

This directory contains specialized skills and context for building AgentPay with Claude Code.

## What is AgentPay?

AgentPay is an AI-native payment orchestration platform built on the Polar infrastructure. It enables conversational payments across messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, and Telegram, with intelligent routing across multiple payment rails (PIX, Stripe, Wise, etc.).

**Vision**: "Wherever intent is expressed, payment can be understood, negotiated, and completed — intelligently and transparently."

## How to Use These Skills

### When Working on Specific Features

Reference the relevant skill to get guidance on implementation:

**Example**: Implementing payment orchestration
```
"I need to implement the payment orchestration service that selects
optimal payment rails. Review .claude/skills/payment-orchestration.md
for guidance."
```

**Example**: Building intent recognition
```
"Help me build the intent classification system. Follow the patterns
in .claude/skills/intent-recognition.md."
```

### 5. Trust Layer (`trust-layer.md`)

**Purpose**: Build explainability, compliance, and fraud detection.

**Key Topics**:
- Explainability engine
- KYC/AML compliance
- Fraud detection
- Audit logging
- Regulatory compliance

**Use When**:
- Implementing compliance features
- Adding fraud detection rules
- Generating explanations
- Meeting regulatory requirements

### 6. API Integration (`api-integration.md`)

**Purpose**: Guide integration with external services.

**Key Topics**:
- Payment rail APIs (PIX, Stripe, Wise)
- Messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Slack)
- Accounting systems (QuickBooks, Xero)
- LLM services (Claude, GPT)

**Use When**:
- Adding new integrations
- Debugging API issues
- Setting up webhooks
- Writing integration tests

## Best Practices

### 1. Read Relevant Skills First

Before implementing a feature, read the relevant skill document. It will:
- Save time by providing proven patterns
- Prevent common mistakes
- Ensure consistency across the codebase
- Guide testing strategy

### 2. Follow Polar's Patterns

AgentPay builds on Polar. Always:
- Use service/repository pattern
- Never call `session.commit()` directly
- Use async/await consistently
- Follow Polar's module structure

See `prompts/development-guidelines.md` for details.

### 3. Reference Skills in Conversations

When working with Claude Code, explicitly reference skills:

Good:
```
"Following the patterns in .claude/skills/payment-orchestration.md,
implement the Wise adapter for cross-border payments."
```

Better:
```
"Review .claude/skills/payment-orchestration.md and
.claude/skills/api-integration.md (Wise section), then implement
the Wise payment rail adapter with proper error handling and tests."
```

### 4. Keep Skills Updated
