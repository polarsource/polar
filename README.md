## Polar.sh: A Patreon for Open Source Developers
A creator platform for developers and the open source ecosystem ‚Äì built open source (Apache 2.0).

Offering you ‚Äì as a developer ‚Äì  a platform on top of your GitHub repositories to:

- Build, own & reach your audience through free- and premium posts and newsletters.
- Offer subscriptions of value-add benefits designed for our ecosystem & built-in to Polar. We'll handle value-add taxes.
- Get funding behind your GitHub issues & split it with contributors (Rewards)
- Integrate it all on your own docs, sites or services using our API & SDK.

### Subscriptions

- **Reach your entire audience with free tier(s).** You can build, grow & reach your entire audience (you own it and can export them at any time). They can subscribe for free with email-only and upgrade to paid later. Substack-style.
- **Polar handles value-add taxes for paid tier(s).** We're proud to be the merchant of record & manage value-add taxes to enable this for individual developers.
- **Unique business subscriptions.** Enabling all their team members to gain access to benefits. Offering unparalleled opportunities and value to subscriptions offered via Polar to businesses.
- **Powerful, built-in, benefits.** Going beyond free text upsells to built-in services you can easily manage via Polar. Delightful for backers to consume.

We're going to invest heavily in automating typical benefits offered within the open source ecosystem. Making it seamless for you to manage & delightful for your backers to use. Some ideas in our pipeline short-term:

- **Discord invites (unique roles per tier)**
- **Sponsor Logo Automation.** Businesses can setup their logotype & description once and it automatically propagating across your README (PR/SVG) to sites/docs (SDK)
- **Early access (private repo collaborators)**
- **Sponsored Posts**

## Contributions

You can develop on Polar in GitHub Codespaces. The environment is pre-configured to contain (most) of the tools that you'll need, and will help you to configure the integration between Polar and GitHub (see [.devcontainer/README](./.devcontainer/README.md)). Using an instance with at least 4 cores is recommended.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/polarsource/polar)

You can also develop on Polar locally on your computer, which is the recommended way of working if you want to get into the deep of how Polar works. Documentation on how to setup a development environment is incoming. Until then, if you're feeling adventurous checkout our repository structure below and [clients/README](./clients/README.md) and [server/README](./server/README.md) in particular.
