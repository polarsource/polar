## Introducing Polar

Polar gives open source maintainers a better and funded backlog based on what drives the most impact within their community.

For maintainers:
1. **Embedded pledges.** Our Github app can automatically embed the Polar badge to get backers and pledges.
2. **Better backlog.** Sorted by feedback and pledges. Filters by progress and stage.
3. **Chrome extension.** Bring Polar with you to enhance Github Issues.

For backers:
1. **Track dependencies.** Automatic detection of internal references to open source issues
2. **Seamless pledging.** Ability to pledge behind them with a credit-card on file.
3. **Monthly budget (Soon).** Automatically distribute a monthly budget across dependencies. Going from one-off to subscription.
