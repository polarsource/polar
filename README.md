## Join the team
[We're hiring](https://polar.sh/careers)!

Our team is based in Stockholm, Sweden today during this founding stage. In the future we intend to go fully remote, and gradually over timezones, but exceptional talent can certainly accelerate our timeline.

## Security
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Polar, we encourage you to responsibly disclose this and not open a public issue. We will investigate all legitimate reports and greatly appreciate your help. Email security@polar.sh to disclose any security vulnerabilities.
