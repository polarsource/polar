## Introducing Polar

**Our goal is to build a subscription network for open source maintainers and their backers**. Empowering maintainers to start and grow independent businesses and for their backers to seamlessly opt-in to premium support, services and packages across their dependencies.

Great businesses are customer obsessed. So we're starting with issues and feature requests.

For maintainers:
1. **Embedded pledges.** Our Github app can automatically embed the Polar badge to get backers and pledges.
2. **Better backlog.** Sorted by feedback and pledges. Filters by progress and stage.
3. **Chrome extension.** Bring Polar with you to enhance Github Issues.

For backers:
1. **Track dependencies.** Automatic detection of internal references to open source issues
2. **Seamless pledging.** Ability to pledge behind them with a credit-card on file.
3. **Monthly budget (Soon).** Automatically distribute a monthly budget across dependencies. Going from one-off to subscription. 


#### Currently in Private Alpha

## Join the team
[We're hiring](https://polar.sh/careers)!

Our team is based in Stockholm, Sweden today during this founding stage. In the future we intend to go fully remote, and gradually over timezones, but exceptional talent can certainly accelerate our timeline.
