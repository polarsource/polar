## Polar: Empowering Open Source Maintainers to Become Entrepreneurs
Our goal is to build a platform for open source maintainers to seamlessly set up, operate and scale value-add services and subscriptions to their backers ‚Äì individuals and businesses alike.

Crafting on-demand and tiered subscription services tailored to suit their initiative, community and their users‚Äô needs. From a suite of offerings such as:
- **Prioritized issues**. What Polar is today with more to come (see below).
- **Backer management & communication**. Automated and streamlined promotions, i.e tiered logos on README/Sites, newsletters, polls etc.
- **Premium support**. Questions, implementation guidance to consultation scheduling etc.
- **Premium access**. Educational material, roadmap voting, early or private access to repositories and packages and more.
- **Custom**. We‚Äôll have a Polar API to enable unlimited creativity for other services you might want to build across your domains and other platforms.

All available in a dashboard designed to make managing these services a delightful experience. In combination with insights and marketing tools to help grow them over time.

[Read more](https://blog.polar.sh/polar-v1-0-lets-fix-open-source-funding/) about our v1.0 goals and our announcement of having raised a $1.8M pre-seed to pursue this vision.

Today, Polar gives open source maintainers a better and funded backlog based on what drives the most impact within their community.

For maintainers:
1. **Embedded pledges.** Our GitHub app can automatically embed the Polar badge to get backers to pledge behind specific issues or features. You can enable it for all or select issues.
2. **Better backlog.** Sorted by feedback and pledges. Filters by progress and stage.
3. **Chrome extension.** Bring Polar with you to enhance GitHub Issues.

For backers (maintainers too):
1. **Track dependencies.** Automatic detection of internal references to open source issues
2. **Seamless pledging.** Ability to pledge behind them with a credit-card on file.
