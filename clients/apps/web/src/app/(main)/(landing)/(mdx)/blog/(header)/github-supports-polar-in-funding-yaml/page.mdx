You can now easily link your Polar page under the "Sponsor this project" section on GitHub - it looks absolutely beautiful üòç

This is huge and all thanks to [@matmair](https://polar.sh/matmair) and our wonderful community! You made this happen, together. We're truly honoured and grateful to serve this amazing community of talented, passionate & kind developers.

## A community united behind the mission
One week ago, Matthias submitted a community request to GitHub: [Please add polar.sh as a platform option in funding.yaml](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/106700)

<blockquote>
Polar is basically like Patreon but has an amazing integration with GitHub [...] and feels much more native than Patreon or Ko-fi. Plus their source is open on GitHub. [...]

Not affiliated with them in any way, just appreciate how well-executed they work in this vital but slow space.
</blockquote>

The post quickly rose to the top of GitHub's community suggestions - thanks to our incredible community and all your upvotes!

Late last night, GitHub responded (on Valentine's no less) quickly that they have now added Polar as a supported funding platform in `FUNDING.yaml`.

**How to set it up**
- Create or modify `.github/FUNDING.yaml` in your desired repositories
- Add the following configuration

```yaml
polar: polarsource
```

- Replace `polarsource` above with the GitHub username or organization name you have connected with Polar

While you're at it...

## Embed subscribe buttons

We've also shipped an embeddable button for READMEs to promote & showcase your subscribers on Polar.

You can easily add it with the following code to support light & darkmode.
- Just make sure to change `polarsource` in the URLs to the GitHub username or organization name you have connected with Polar
