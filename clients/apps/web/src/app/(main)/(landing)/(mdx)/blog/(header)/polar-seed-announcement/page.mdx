Today, we’re thrilled to announce our $10M Seed round led by Accel, with continued support from Abstract & Mischief, alongside an exceptional group of angels: Guillermo Rauch (Vercel), Paul Copplestone (Supabase), Tobi Lütke (Shopify), Harley Finkelstein (Shopify), Michael Grinich (WorkOS), Anton Osika (Lovable), Thomas Paul Mann (Raycast), Jorn van Dijk & Koen Bok (Framer), Zeno Rocha (Resend), Jared Palmer (Vercel), Steven Tey (Dub), and Sébastien & Alexandre Chopin (Nuxt).

We’re proud that thousands of developers now rely on Polar since launching v1.0 in September 2024, growing their revenue an impressive 120%+ month-over-month on average over the past six months.

We're humbled by our incredible community, with 17,000+ signups, 16,000+ followers on X, 5,300 GitHub stars, and 1,500 Discord members rooting for us, providing valuable feedback, features, and pull requests. We couldn’t ask for better community members, investors, and angels to shape the future of software monetization for developers.

**It’s never been easier to build software.** From open source having pushed the envelope of developer velocity to AI now accelerating the trend and making software development accessible to more people.

**It’s never been easier to ship and scale software.** Cloud platforms and modern PaaS solutions like Vercel and Supabase have drastically simplified global software deployment and scaling.

**But, it’s never been harder to monetize software.** We've moved from one-time purchases to SaaS, and now toward usage-based and agentic payments. Each evolution has enabled new category defining businesses, but also added complexity and billing anxiety for developers and their customers alike.

This is a bottleneck for the future.

**We believe the next unicorns will be created by individual developers.** As lines blur between indie hackers, startups, and enterprises, we're building Polar to empower solo builders and early-stage startups – the future enterprises, without the headcount. How?

- **Monetization vs. Billing Platform.** Billing is a crucial part of your customer relationship, but only a part of it - it's the outcome vs. input. We aim to bridge the gap between product analytics, CRM, and billing, providing a comprehensive platform for one-developer unicorns to scale their businesses.

- **Usage-based on Autopilot.** Automatic event ingestion for OpenAI, Anthropic, Vercel AI SDK to S3 consumption and more – easily track, credit and bill customers for their usage. We’re going to ship a lot of innovative features in this category to make usage-based and agentic payments a delight for developers and their customers.

- **Zero Boilerplate.** We obsess over reducing the lines of code in your codebase that aren't unique to your business, from automating common SaaS entitlements like license keys and usage-based credits to condensing integrations down to just four lines of code.

- **Zero Operations.** Grow globally without being held back by international sales tax, compliance, fraud, or chargeback protection – leave it all to us as your merchant of record.

- **Open Source.** Built for transparency and designed for contributions to shape the future with our community.

We’re thrilled to have raised our Seed round with Accel – an iconic fund supporting some of the world’s best startups. This funding will enable us to meaningfully scale our remote-first team across Europe and invest in growth, developer relations, and strategic partnerships across the payments ecosystem.

We’re just getting started.

Join us today to build the future of billing for developers.
