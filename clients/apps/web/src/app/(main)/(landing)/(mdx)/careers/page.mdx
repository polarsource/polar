# Careers

Polar is building the future of payments & billing. Reducing the friction and complexity of integrating complex billing infrastrucutre. We're currently a team of 3 across Stockholm, Sweden & Lyon, France.

We have a few principles to help us shape this future.

- **Maintainers first.** We obsess over their needs and how we can drive capital towards their awesome contributions to human innovation. Everything else is in service of this.
- **Ship → Refactor → Scale.** Our #1 focus and drive is shipping and growing great product experiences that solves real problems for developers and their users. We celebrate pragmatic duct taping behind the scenes and consider scalability, performance and optimization efforts a reward, not our initial focus.
- **Reduce complexity, not quality.** We seek to constantly move faster, but not at the cost of poor product experiences. Simplicity is key to enable this balance and we prioritize it across everything we do. Autonomy and accountability vs. processes. Opinionated design vs. 10 A/B tests. Render vs. K8s etc.
- **Do your life&apos;s work.** We&apos;re not a 9-5 nor 24/7. We don&apos;t track time nor search for people who count it down. We believe work-life balance is not about isolation, but harmony. We love to work and pour our heart into what we build to continuously push the envelope of our creativity and productivity.

### Location
