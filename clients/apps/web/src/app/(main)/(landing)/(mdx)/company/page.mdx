**It’s never been easier to build software.** From open source having pushed the envelope of developer velocity to AI now accelerating the trend and making software development accessible to more people.

**It’s never been easier to ship and scale software.** Cloud platforms and modern PaaS solutions like Vercel and Supabase have drastically simplified global software deployment and scaling.

**But, it’s never been harder to monetize software.** We've moved from one-time purchases to SaaS, and now toward usage-based and agentic payments. Each evolution has enabled new category defining businesses, but also added complexity and billing anxiety for developers and their customers alike.

This is a bottleneck for the future.

**We believe the next unicorns will be created by individual developers.** As lines blur between indie hackers, startups, and enterprises, we're building Polar to empower solo builders and early-stage startups – the future enterprises, without the headcount. How?

- **Monetization vs. Billing Platform.** Billing is a crucial part of your customer relationship, but only a part of it - it's the outcome vs. input. We aim to bridge the gap between product analytics, CRM, and billing, providing a comprehensive platform for one-developer unicorns to scale their businesses.

- **Usage-based on Autopilot.** Automatic event ingestion for OpenAI, Anthropic, Vercel AI SDK to S3 consumption and more – easily track, credit and bill customers for their usage. We’re going to ship a lot of innovative features in this category to make usage-based and agentic payments a delight for developers and their customers.

- **Zero Boilerplate.** We obsess over reducing the lines of code in your codebase that aren't unique to your business, from automating common SaaS entitlements like license keys and usage-based credits to condensing integrations down to just four lines of code.

- **Zero Operations.** Grow globally without being held back by international sales tax, compliance, fraud, or chargeback protection – leave it all to us as your merchant of record.

- **Open Source.** Built for transparency and designed for contributions to shape the future with our community.
