## Mission

Polar is building the future of payments & billing. Reducing the friction and complexity of integrating complex billing infrastrucutre. We're currently a team of 3 across Stockholm, Sweden & Lyon, France. We have a few principles to help us shape this future.

#### Ship → Refactor → Scale

Our #1 focus and drive is shipping and growing great product experiences that solves real problems for developers and their users. We celebrate pragmatic duct taping behind the scenes and consider scalability, performance and optimization efforts a reward, not our initial focus.

#### Reduce complexity, not quality

We seek to constantly move faster, but not at the cost of poor product experiences. Simplicity is key to enable this balance and we prioritize it across everything we do. Autonomy and accountability vs. processes. Opinionated design vs. 10 A/B tests. Render vs. K8s etc.

#### Do your life&apos;s work

We&apos;re not a 9-5 nor 24/7. We don&apos;t track time nor search for people who count it down. We believe work-life balance is not about isolation, but harmony. We love to work and pour our heart into what we build to continuously push the envelope of our creativity and productivity.

## Location

We have an office in Stockholm currently given our team to date. However, our intention is to be a remote company now and in the future.

#### About you

- You are passionate about building great user experiences and products.
- You&apos;re humble and eager to constantly learn and improve based on feedback from customers and peers or new insights, technical trends and tools.
- You&apos;re pragmatic and prefer shipping over perfecting code
- Coding and/or design is your hobby as well as profession.
- You&apos;re autonomous and don&apos;t hesitate to roll up your sleeves to get stuff done vs. waiting on instructions, guidance or permission.
- You&apos;re entrepreneurial and eager to be a part of building something for the long-term and from scratch within a small team with large individual responsibility & impact.
