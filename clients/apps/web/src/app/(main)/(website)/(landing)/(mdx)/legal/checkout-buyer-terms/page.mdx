Agreement included with Software or as otherwise agreed between you and
the Supplier.

**Payment, Taxes and Refunds**

Polar uses a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to
charge your chosen payment method (such as card or charge to your
payment account) for all Transactions, including any applicable taxes
based on the billing address of the Transaction or other applicable
nexus rules. . The processing of payments will be subject to the terms,
conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to
this Agreement. We are not responsible for errors by the Payment
Processor. By utilizing the Services, you agree to pay us, through the
Payment Processor, in accordance with the applicable payment terms.

We reserve the right to change prices and to offer discounts and
temporary promotions in conjunction with the applicable Supplier. You
agree that it is your responsibility to maintain a valid payment method
on file with us while using our Services.. You irrevocably and expressly
authorize us to withhold any monies and/or debit any monies from any
account that you have identified to Company for any chargebacks, fees,
costs, deductions, adjustments and any other amounts owed to Company.

You agree to receipt of all invoices and receipts in an electronic
format, which includes email. If technical problems prevent or
unreasonably delay delivery of the Product, your exclusive and sole
remedy is either replacement of the Product or refund of the price paid,
as determined by Polar in conjunction with the applicable Supplier. When
providing us with your information, you must ensure that it is
up-to-date and accurate. Polar will not be responsible for the event of
non-receipt of the Product due to incorrect information being provided
by you. To make amendments to your Transaction, please contact us at
[<u>support@polar.sh</u>](mailto:support@polar.sh). We reserve the right
to not fulfill and to cancel your Transaction if our Payment Processor
is unable to process your payment.

**Chargebacks**

We understand that there may be occasions where you may not recognize or
wish to dispute a payment made to Polar in relation to a Transaction.

Chargeback is a mechanism for your payment card issuer to reclaim money
from a retailer’s bank. This can allow your card issuer to provide you
with a refund if:

- You do not receive the Product you paid for;

- You are charged the wrong amount or are charged twice by mistake; or

- The payment was made fraudulently.

Please contact Polar first to resolve any billing issue. You retain any
chargeback rights provided by your card issuer. If you initiate a
chargeback for a validly authorized and delivered Transaction, Polar may
submit evidence to your card issuer to contest the chargeback in
accordance with card network rules. You agree to cooperate in good faith
to resolve Transaction disputes and provide accurate information upon
request so Polar may comply with card network rules.

**Termination and Suspension of Services**

Polar may suspend or terminate the Services or your access to a Product
upon: (a) your material breach of this Agreement that remains uncured
for ten (10) days after notice; (b) suspected fraud, payment failures,
violation of our [Acceptable Use Policy](/legal/acceptable-use-policy) or unlawful conduct, in which
case we may act immediately; (c) legal, regulatory, or card network
requirements. We will provide notice of any termination or suspension
where practicable. Upon termination, you remain responsible for amounts
due up to the effective date of the termination. Termination will not
affect rights already granted to you by the Supplier under the Supplier
Agreement.

**Refund Policy**

Refunds are evaluated consistent with applicable law, the applicable
refund policy and the card network rules. This Agreement does not limit
any non-waivable consumer rights or remedies. Polar may deny a refund
where we reasonably determine fraud, abuse, misuse or non-compliance
with the applicable refund policy; however, we will not restrict your
rights to pursue chargebacks as permitted by your card issuer. If we
contest a chargeback, we will do so in accordance with card network
rules.

**Subscriptions**

The Services may allow you to purchase access to Product on a
subscription basis (“Paid Subscriptions”). Paid Subscriptions renew
automatically until you cancel. We will notify you in advance if the
price of a Paid Subscription increases or taxes become payable and, if
required by applicable law, seek your affirmative consent to continue.
We will provide renewal reminders as required by applicable law. You’ll
be charged on the day the Paid Subscription period renews. You may
cancel at any time, effective at the next billing cycle, by using the
self-serve online cancellation flow in your account or by contacting us
via support@polar.sh. We will provide a confirmation of cancellation.
Except as required by law or where the Product has not been provided,
fees for elapsed billing periods are non-refundable.

Certain Paid Subscriptions may offer a free trial before charging you.
If you decide to unsubscribe from a Paid Subscription before we start
charging your payment method, you must cancel the subscription before
the expiration of the trial period via your customer account portal or
by contacting us at support@polar.sh.

If we cannot charge your payment method for any reason (such as
expiration or insufficient funds), and you have not cancelled your Paid
Subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. We may
continue to attempt to charge your payment method in accordance with
applicable law. We reserve the right to suspend your Paid Subscription
if we are unable to successfully charge your payment method to renew
your subscription. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that we will
be unable to successfully charge your payment method, your Paid
Subscription will be cancelled.

**Agreement Changes**

Polar reserves the right at any time to modify this Agreement with
notice. Any material change that adversely affects you will take effect
only after we provide at least thirty (30) days’ advance notice and
obtain your affirmative consent where required by law. If you do not
agree, you may terminate this Agreement before the change takes effect.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS ARE
PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, AND POLAR DISCLAIMS ALL
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT LIMIT ANY
NON-WAIVABLE WARRANTIES OR REMEDIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT FOR (A)
YOUR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS; (B) YOUR BREACH OF IP RIGHTS OR
CONFIDENTIALITY; OR (C) YOUR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, EACH PARTY’S
TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT
EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO POLAR FOR THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE
GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT. NEITHER
PARTY IS LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, OR BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION. THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY THAT

reasonable control, including acts of God, labor disputes, internet or

the affected party uses commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate and
resume performance.

**Waiver and Severability**

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the parties
nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the
parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other
provisions of these terms remain in full force and effect. Polar’s
acquiescence in the breach of a provision of this Agreement or failure
to act upon such breach does not waive Polar’s right to act with respect
to subsequent or similar breaches. Likewise, the delay or failure of
Polar to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement
shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

least reasonable care, use it only to perform under this Agreement, and
not disclose it except to personnel and advisors with a need to know
under obligations of confidentiality. Exceptions apply for information
that is public, already known, independently developed, or rightfully

notice to the other party and cooperate to seek protective treatment.

OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF. Either party may bring an
individual claim in small claims court in the state of Delaware.
