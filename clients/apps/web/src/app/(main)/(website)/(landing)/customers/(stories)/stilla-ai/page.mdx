### What payment or billing challenges were you facing before using Polar?

We were building our billing infrastructure from scratch. We needed seat-based billing, organization-level billing management, and flexible trials - all while moving fast. Our requirement was getting production-ready billing infrastructure live in hours, not weeks.

### Why did you choose Polar for your payment infrastructure over other providers?

Polar had everything we needed out of the box: seat-based billing model already enabled, a clean Python SDK, and webhook infrastructure. But what sealed it was their willingness to build organization billing primitives as a design partner.

They moved on a rapid timeline to add nested customer support (organization with member customers), gave us granular control over the customer portal, and advanced control mechanisms for seamless UX and user communication. Most payment providers can't move that fast or adapt to B2B-specific needs.

### How has Polar's payment platform helped solve your challenges or improve your business operations?

Developer Experience: The Python SDK and webhook infrastructure made integration straightforward. We had production-ready billing in hours, not weeks.

The customer portal customization was critical - we could hide usage stats and direct cancellation while keeping payment methods and invoices accessible.

Polar's trial mechanism allowed us to experiment with free trials without friction. Discount codes with usage limits let us create targeted offers. The seat-based model with flexible pricing (daily/monthly/yearly) matched our go-to-market strategy perfectly.

We launched billing in a few days and have been onboarding customers since. The integration has been rock-solid - all automated smoke tests consistently pass.

### How was the help when you ran into problems?

We have a shared Slack channel for direct engineering collaboration. When we hit issues - webhook validation, sandbox setup, user deletion edge cases - we got answers fast.

The Polar team treated us like a design partner, not just a customer. They built features we needed on tight timelines and worked collaboratively to resolve issues. That's rare.
