<Callout type="WARNING">
**Active subscribers & customers will lose access too!**

Deleting a file permanently deletes it from Polar and our S3 buckets except for
the metadata. Disable the file instead if you don't want it permanently deleted.

</Callout>

### Disable & enable files

You can disable files at any point to prevent new customers getting access to
it.

<Callout type="NOTE">
**Existing customers retain their access**

Customers who purchased once the file enabled will still have access
to legacy files. Just new customers will be impacted.

</Callout>

<Callout type="NOTE">
**Enabling or adding files grants access retroactively**

In case you add more files or re-enable existing ones, all current customers and
subscribers with the benefit will be granted access.
