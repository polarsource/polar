3. Choose `GitHub Repository Access` as the `Type`

You'll need to first `Connect your GitHub Account` and install a dedicated Polar
App for this benefit across the repositories you want to use it with.

- Click `Connect your GitHub Account`

<Callout type="NOTE">
**Why do I need to connect GitHub again and install a separate app?**

This feature requires permission to manage repository collaborators.
GitHub Apps does not support progressive permission scope requests.
So instead of requesting this sensitive permission from all users (unnecessarily)
in our core GitHub Login this feature uses a standalone app instead.

</Callout>

![GitHub Permission Grant](./grant.png)

Once you've authorized our dedicated GitHub App for this feature you'll be
redirected back to Polar and the benefit form - now connected and updated.

**Repository**

Select the desired repository you want to automate collaborator invites for.

<Callout type="NOTE">
**Why can I only connect organization repositories vs. personal ones?**

GitHub does not support granular permissions for collaborators on personal
repositories - granting them all write permissions instead. Since collaborators
would then be able to push changes, releases and more, we do not support
personal repositories by default.

Want this still? [Reach out to us](/docs/support) and we can enable it.

</Callout>

**Role**

Select the role you want to grant collaborators.

- **Read (Default & Highly recommended)**
- Triage
- Write
- Maintain
- Admin

Read access (read-only) is what 99.9% of cases should use and the others are
highly discouraged unless you have special use cases & absolutely know the
impact of these permissions. Checkout the [GitHub
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization#permissions-for-each-role)
for reference.

<Callout type="CAUTION">
**Additional Costs for Paid GitHub Organizations**

GitHub treats collaborators as a seat and they will incurr charges accordingly to your
billing unless you're using a free GitHub organization plan. So make sure to
confirm you're on a free plan OR charge sufficiently to offset the costs you'll
need to pay to GitHub.

</Callout>
