# Product & Subscription Benefits

![Enable Benefits on Products](./benefits.light.png)

Product and subscription benefits are standalone resources in Polar - connected to one or many products or subscription tiers.

This approach is a bit different from other platforms, but offers many advantages:
- Easy to enable the same benefit across multiple products & subscriptions
- You can change a benefit in one place vs. many
- No duplicate data or work (error prone)
- More intuitive UI for you and your customers

**How customers get access to benefits:**
- ✅ Active subscribers of tiers with the benefit enabled
- ✅ Customers who bought a product with the benefit (lifetime access)
- ❌ Subscribers with an expired subscription (cancelled)
- ❌ Users who are not customers

## Creating & Managing Benefits

You can manage benefits in two ways:
1. Directly within a product create/edit form
2. Or via `Products` > `Benefits` in your dashboard (below)
