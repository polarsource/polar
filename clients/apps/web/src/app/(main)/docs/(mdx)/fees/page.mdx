# Fees

## Transaction fees

All transactions on Polar come with a small fee of 4% + 40¢ - applied to the entire
transaction amount.

Polar is currently built on Stripe, and we cover their 2.9% + 30¢ fee from ours.
However, they impose a few additional fees for certain transactions that we need to pass on.

**Additional fees**

- +1.5% for international cards (non-US)
- +0.5% for subscription payments
- _We also reserve the right to pass on any other fees Stripe might impose in
  the future_

**Example**

Let's look at an example breakdown with all these additional fees applied.
Below is a payment of a $30 subscription from Sweden (25% VAT).

| Item                        | Amount    |
| --------------------------- | --------- |
| Product Price               | $30       |
| VAT (25%)                   | $7.5      |
| **Total Transaction Value** | **$37.5** |
| Transaction Fee (4% + 40¢)  | $1.9      |
| International Card (+1.5%)  | $0.56     |
| Subscription (+0.5%)        | $0.19     |
