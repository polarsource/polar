# Fees

## Transaction fees

All transactions on Polar come with a small fee of 4% + 40¢ - applied to the entire
transaction amount.

Polar is currently built on Stripe, and we cover their 2.9% + 30¢ fee from ours.
However, they impose a few additional fees for certain transactions that we need to pass on.

**Additional fees**

- +1.5% for international cards (non-US)
- +0.5% for subscription payments
- _We also reserve the right to pass on any other fees Stripe might impose in
  the future_

**Example**

Let's look at an example breakdown with all these additional fees applied.
Below is a payment of a $30 subscription from Sweden (25% VAT).

| Item                        | Amount    |
| --------------------------- | --------- |
| Product Price               | $30       |
| VAT (25%)                   | $7.5      |
| **Total Transaction Value** | **$37.5** |
| Transaction Fee (4% + 40¢)  | $1.9      |
| International Card (+1.5%)  | $0.56     |
| Subscription (+0.5%)        | $0.19     |
| **Total Fees**              | **$2.65** |

## Payout fees

Polar does not add any additional fees to payouts. All fees below are from the
available payout providers and without any premium.

In addition, Polar offers manual withdrawals for developers. Keeping you in
control of when to issue payouts.

_Unless you have a Polar balance that you haven't withdrawn for several months, at
which point we'll eventually need to trigger a payout on your behalf._

**Stripe**

- $2 per month of active payout(s)
- 0.25% + $0.25 per payout
- Cross border fees (currency conversion): 0.25% (EU) - 1% in other countries.

**Open Collective**

- 10% on amount transferred

## Dispute fees

In some circumstances, customers can open a **dispute** to their bank if they don't recognize the payment that has been made. In this case, our payment processor immediately withdraws funds and bills us dispute fees. Those fees are not refunded, even if the dispute is won in our favor. That's why we pass on this fee.

This fee is usually around **$15** per dispute.
