# Payouts

You can issue a withdrawal, i.e payout, at any time once there is at least **$10 on your balance**. We
will then transfer the balance minus Stripe payout fees (see below) to your Stripe account & issue a payout on their
side.

## Manual Withdrawal

We require this to be done manually since:

1. Users have requested control for easier accounting vs. frequent & small payouts
2. Giving users control of Stripe payout fees

**Stripe Payout Fees**

1. $2 per month of active payout(s)
2. 0.25% + $0.25 per payout
3. Cross border fees (currency conversion): 0.25% (EU) - 1% in other countries.

Given the fixed costs, we want to default to manual payouts so you can control
when you want to incurr them and do it once vs. per each individual transaction
in order to reduce the overall fees.
