# Invoices & Tax Forms

### 1099-K Form (US)

Polar will issue 1099-K forms via Stripe to eligible users in the US on an annual basis.

For tax year 2023, 1099-K forms are required for users who received:

1. $20,000 in gross volume (USD)
2. Over 200 transactions

IRS has expressed intent to lower the threshold to be equilivant to other 1099
forms, e.g NEC, at $600. However, it's still being discussed and is not
guaranteed for 2024 and onward. Stripe keeps the thresholds up-to-date based on
the requirements and their developments.

**Why not a 1099-NEC or 1099-MISC?**

TurboTax has [this great article](https://blog.turbotax.intuit.com/self-employed/1099-misc-or-1099-k-whats-the-difference-29903/) on the difference between 1099-K, 1099-NEC & 1099-MISC

<blockquote>
If you’re self-employed and accept credit, debit, or prepaid cards, you may receive Form 1099-K for transactions processed by a third party. This includes creators, influencers, rideshare drivers, or side-giggers. If you’re an online seller selling on platforms like Ebay, AirBnB, Etsy, and VRBO, you may also receive Form 1099-K.
</blockquote>

Stripe further clarifies 1099-K requirements for Payment Settlement Entities
(PSE) in [this
article](https://support.stripe.com/questions/intro-to-1099-k-tax-forms-for-platforms-and-marketplaces).

Effectively, `1099-K` is required for platforms/marketplaces which:

1. Handles payment between someone providing goods/services to purchasers
2. Such payments are made with credit, debit, or prepaid cards.
3. Receiver is not a contractor/freelancer to the platform/marketplace

Polar meets all of these criterias and therefore issues 1099-K forms to eligible
developers on the platform vs. other forms.
