<Callout type="IMPORTANT">
**What does 'Act on my behalf' mean?**

It's a default notice from GitHub for all OAuth requests [#37117](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/37117).

Rest assured, we do not do anything on your behalf without a delibrate action
performed by you via Polar for an explicit, clear & desired outcome by you.

## Create your organization

Once you've signed up, you'll be taken to a page to create your **organization**. On Polar, an organization is the space where you'll create and manage your products, receive donations from your supporters and more.

The first step is to give it a name.

A **slug** is automatically generated from the name. It's the unique identifier for your organization that'll determine your Polar URL. You can customize it as long as it doesn't already exist on Polar. **You won't be able to change it.** However, you'll be able able to change the display name later.
