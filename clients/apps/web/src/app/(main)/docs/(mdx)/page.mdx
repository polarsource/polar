## The Merchant of Record for Developers

Our mission is to get developers paid coding on their passion.

By building the best monetization platform for developers - open source
maintainers, indie hackers, builders and startups alike. How?

1. Offer a world-class [Dashboard](/docs/products),
[Checkout](/docs/checkout), [API](/docs/api) & [SDKs](/docs/developers/sdk)
designed for developers to make shipping & monetizing easier and faster vs. with PSPs.
2. Richer Product & Subscriptions support with built-in automation for common upsales across our ecosystem, e.g [file
downloads](/docs/benefits/file-downloads), [license
keys](/docs/benefits/license-keys), [Discord roles &
invites](/docs/benefits/discord), [GitHub
repositories](/docs/benefits/github-repositories) and more.
3. Be a [Merchant of Record (MoR) provider](/docs/merchant-of-record/tax) to reduce headaches, overhead & operations from selling digital services
internationally.
4. Build Polar [open source](https://github.com/polarsource/polar) and in public
([Discord](https://dub.sh/polar-discord) &
[Twitter](https://x.com/polar_sh)) together with our community and with exceptional support.

Focus on shipping and leave billing, taxes and headaches to us.
