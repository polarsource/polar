# Create Products & Subscription Tiers

<Callout type="NOTE">
**Everything is a product**

Subscriptions or pay once products are both technically a product in Polar (API
& data model). Just with different pricing & billing logic. So both are shown &
managed under `Products` with the ability to filter based on pricing model.

#### Pay what you want (Soon)

### Subscription Audience

In case you chose `Subscription` pricing you'll be promoted to specify the
target audience: `Individual` or `Business`.

We use this information to clearly distinguish intended audience on your Polar
page. However, it does not impact the checkout (customers can provide their
business registration number regardless) or buyer experience.

### Product Media

- They can be up to 10MB each
- First image becomes the primary shown on listing pages
- You can remove and re-arrange images

### Product Benefits

Finally, we can enable or create new benefits that we tie to the product.
