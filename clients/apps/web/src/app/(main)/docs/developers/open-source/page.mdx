# Contribute

**Polar is proudly built open source (Apache 2.0).** You can find our entire product & docs on our [GitHub](https://github.com/polarsource/polar)


You can develop on Polar in GitHub Codespaces. The environment is pre-configured to contain (most) of the tools that you'll need, and will help you to configure the integration between Polar and GitHub (see [.devcontainer/README](https://github.com/polarsource/polar/blob/main/.devcontainer/README.md)). Using an instance with at least 4 cores is recommended.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/polarsource/polar)

You can also develop on Polar locally on your computer. It's the recommended
way of working if you want to make contributions on a regular basis.

Documentation on how to setup a development environment is incoming. Until then,
if you're feeling adventurous checkout our repository structure below and
  [clients/README](https://github.com/polarsource/polar/blob/main/clients/README.md) and [server/README](https://github.com/polarsource/polar/blob/main/server/README.md) in particular.
