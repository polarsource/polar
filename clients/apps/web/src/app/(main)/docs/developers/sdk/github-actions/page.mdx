# GitHub Actions

We provide a set of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/polarsource/actions) to help you integrate Polar into your GitHub Actions workflow.

## `polarsource/actions/auth`

This action allows you to generate a temporary Polar API token for your workflow, **without the need to generate a long-lived personal access token**.

## `polarsource/actions/ads`

This action allows you to automatically synchronize the ads created by your customers as part of an [Ad benefit](https://docs.polar.sh/benefits/ads) in a Markdown or HTML page.
