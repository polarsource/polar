# Monetizing your Figma plugin

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of monetizing your Figma plugin using the Polar SDK.

### Prerequisites

- A Figma account
- A Polar account
- A Figma plugin

## Creating a product with License Key Benefit

The best way to monetize your Figma plugin is to use a License Key Benefit. This benefit type allows you to sell access to your plugin to users.

The flow would look something like this:

1. User installs your plugin
2. User gets a prompt to enter their license key
3. User buys a license key from your Polar product page
4. User adds the license key to your plugin
5. User can now use your plugin & you've made a few bucks!

### Creating a product

Head over to your Polar dashboard and click on **Products** in the sidebar. Then click on **New Product**. Fill in the details for your product.

### Adding the License Key Benefit

Once you've entered product details and pricing information, you'll see a section for **Benefits**. Expand the License Key tab & press **Create New**.

This will expand the License Key modal, where you can configure the license key settings. Configure how the license key should be used in your plugin.

Perfect! You've now created a product, which grants an associated license key to the customer.

## Configure a personal access token

In order to use the Polar SDK, you'll need to configure a personal access token. This token will be used to authenticate your plugin when it requests information from Polar.

To create a personal access token, click on your profile dropdown in the top right corner of the Polar dashboard and select **Account** or press [here](https://polar.sh/settings). 

<BrowserCallout type="CAUTION">
It's important that you keep this token secret at all times, as it grants access to your Polar account.
