# Sponsorship Placement (Ads)

Want to offer sponsors a logotype placement in your newsletter, README or anywhere else? You can easily with Polar.
- Set custom image dimensions per benefit
- Customers can self-manage uploading their logotypes in your dimensions
- Offering light & dark mode options

<BrowserCallout type="NOTE">
**No review/approval process of uploaded images.**

Sponsors with this benefit can upload any image. In our newsletter, you see the image before publishing, but automated elsewhere there is always the risk of bad images being uploaded.
</BrowserCallout>

## Create Ads Benefit

1. Goto `Products` > `Benefits`
2. Click `+` to create a new benefit
3. Choose `Ad` as the `Type`

![Create an ad benefit](./create-benefit.dark.png)
![Create an ad benefit](./create-benefit.light.png)

You can customize the benefit description, and the image width and height of your ad space.

When you've created the benefit, go to your subscription tiers and add the benefit to the relevant tiers.

![Configure ad](./configure-ad.dark.png)
![Configure ad](./configure-ad.light.png)

Subscribers to your ads tier can manage their own ad content from the Benefits page.

From there, the subscriber can upload their images (in light and dark mode! 😎), and configure the text and link.
