# For Customers

Polar uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) for all payments.

Whether you're pledging to fund an issue, buying a digital product or
subscription. Stripe is a leading payment provider and they securely process and store - in case of subscriptions - your credit card details or
other payment methods.

Currently, we support payments to be made in USD only and using the following
payment methods:

- Credit/debit cards
- Apple Pay
- Google Pay

You get a receipt from Polar via Stripe for each transaction made.

### Subscriptions

You can subscribe to creators to gain access to additional benefits they offer as part of the selected subscription tier.

By subscribing, you pay the monthly subscription cost and any applicable taxes (see [Taxes](#taxes) below) directly and recurringly
each month thereafter. Billing is therefore done individually per subscription vs. once in case of multiple subscriptions.

**Unsubscribing**

You can find all of your active subscriptions & unsubscribe at any time in your [settings](https://polar.sh/settings).

### Taxes (VAT, Sales Tax, etc)

Subscriptions can be or become subject to value-add taxes, e.g Sales Tax, VAT
etc, depending on the benefits offered and your location - also determening the
amount (%) owed.

In case value-add taxes apply today, it will be specified clearly at the point of
subscribing - both the percentage applied and amount.

In the event taxes apply in the future or apply differently, we will communicate
such changes in advance to you over email before the next billing cycle and you
can decide whether you want to continue subscribing at the updated cost or
unsubscribe in your settings.

### Business Subscriptions

Of course, we support business subscriptions as well. You can provide your local
business registration number at the point of subscribing. It will then be
validated, reflected on the receipt and impact the value-add tax applied.
This includes not adding the value-add tax in case of the reverse charge mechanism being
applicable.
