### Basic formatting

Full markdown support with GitHub flavours. See [GitHub Markdown
Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
for a complete guide.

### Code highlighting

Using [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki), we support syntax highlighting for most languages out of the
box - online and over email. Combined with offering easy clipboard copying for online
readers.

```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
      return a + b
```

- Just wrap code in three backticks, e.g \`\`\`python [CODE] \`\`\`

### Admonitions
