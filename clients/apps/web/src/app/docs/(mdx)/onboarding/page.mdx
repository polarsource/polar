# Quick Start

Let's get you up and running with Polar in only a few minutes.

## Create an account
Signup & login on Polar is made super easy with GitHub Login (OAuth).

<GithubLoginButton
  className="text-white mb-8"
  size="small"
  text="Continue with GitHub"
  userSignupType={UserSignupType.MAINTAINER}
  returnTo="/maintainer"
/>

- By continuing you agree to our [Terms of Service](/legal/terms) and [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy)
- You'll be redirected to login with GitHub (next step)

<BrowserCallout type="NOTE">
  In the future, we'll support standalone accounts without GitHub too - discussed in [#3608](https://github.com/orgs/polarsource/discussions/3608)
</BrowserCallout>

### Grant GitHub Permissions

Polar uses your GitHub Login to:

- Create a matching, public, profile for you on Polar (avatar, username, bio etc)
- Setup your Polar page: `https://polar.sh/<username>`
- Request read-only access to your primary GitHub email addresses so we can communicate with you, e.g send funding, subscription and order notifications and product updates.

<BrowserCallout type="IMPORTANT">
#### What does 'Act on my behalf' mean?

It's a default notice from GitHub for all OAuth requests [#37117](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/37117).

Rest assured, we do not do anything on your behalf without a delibrate action
performed by you via Polar for an explicit, clear & desired outcome by you.

</BrowserCallout>

## Onboarding

Once you've signed up, you'll be taken through a quick onboarding page intended to focus the Polar experience for your use case.
