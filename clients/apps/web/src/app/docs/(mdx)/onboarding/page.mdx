# Quick Start

Let's get you up and running with Polar in only a few minutes.

## Create an account

Signup & login on Polar is made super easy with GitHub Login (OAuth).

<div className="not-prose">
  <GithubLoginButton
    className="mb-8 text-white"
    size="small"
    text="Continue with GitHub"
    userSignupType={UserSignupType.MAINTAINER}
    returnTo="/dashboard"
  />
</div>

- By continuing you agree to our [Terms of Service](/legal/terms) and [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy)
- You'll be redirected to login with GitHub (next step)

### Grant GitHub Permissions

Polar uses your GitHub Login to:

- Create a matching, public, profile for you on Polar (avatar, username, bio etc)
- Request read-only access to your primary GitHub email addresses so we can communicate with you, e.g send funding, subscription and order notifications and product updates.

<BrowserCallout type="IMPORTANT">
#### What does 'Act on my behalf' mean?

It's a default notice from GitHub for all OAuth requests [#37117](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/37117).

Rest assured, we do not do anything on your behalf without a delibrate action
performed by you via Polar for an explicit, clear & desired outcome by you.

## Create your organization

Once you've signed up, you'll be taken to a page to create your **organization**. On Polar, an organization is the space where you'll create and manage your products, receive donations from your supporters and more.

The first step is to give it a name.

A **slug** is automatically generated from the name. It's the unique identifier for your organization that'll determine your Polar URL. You can customize it as long as it doesn't already exist on Polar. **You won't be able to change it.** However, you'll be able able to change the display name later.

Then, you'll be able to select which features you want to enable to focus the Polar experience for your use case. **You can change this later too.** So no pressure or identity crisis needed :^)
