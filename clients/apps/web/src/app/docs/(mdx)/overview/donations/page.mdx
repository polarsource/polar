### Enabling donations

Let's start with enabling it on your Polar page.

1. Go to the new `Donations` page in your dashboard
2. Click `Enable donations` and that's it. New to Polar? Please goto `Finance` and start setting up Stripe too - ensuring you're in a [supported country](/docs/overview/faq/for-maintainers/#which-countries-are-supported) for payouts.

That's it. You can now click `Public page` to see what it looks like.

### Receiving donations

Your audience can now see the donation option underneath your profile in connection with existing subscribers.

From there they can insert an amount and message. Enter their payment method or select an existing one saved on file - for existing users with saved details from before.

Done. Just donated $10 in a few seconds.

### Donation Statistics

As a developer, I receive a notification of new donations and can easily keep track in the dashboard over time.

Have the Discord webhook setup with Polar for notifications? Donations will be shared there too.
