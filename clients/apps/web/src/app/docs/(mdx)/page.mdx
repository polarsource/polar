## Why Polar vs. X?

There are a lot of options out there. So why use Polar?

- We're the [Merchant of Record](/docs/merchant-of-record/tax) and handle Sales tax & EU VAT so you don't have
  to
- Built-in benefits to upsell designed for the developer ecosystem, e.g Discord
  invites, GitHub repository access, premium newsletter, file downloads and
  more.
- [Official GitHub funding.yaml option](/docs/github/funding-yaml)
- [Newsletter](/docs/newsletter) is built-in vs. a costly add-on
- [Powerful API](/docs/api) & built 100% open source for the developer ecosystem
- [Transparent pricing](/docs#pricing). No games or schemes. Others say 5%, but
  apply it to the full amount including VAT. We don't - you deserve not to get squeezed.
