<BrowserCallout type="NOTE">
**Everything is a product**

Subscriptions or pay once products are both technically a product in Polar (API
& data model). Just with different pricing & billing logic. So both are shown &
managed under `Products` with the ability to filter based on pricing model.

### Subscription Audience

In case you chose `Subscription` pricing you'll be promoted to specify the
target audience: `Individual` or `Business`.

We use this information to clearly distinguish intended audience on your Polar
page. However, it does not impact the checkout (customers can provide their
business registration number regardless) or buyer experience.

### Product Media
