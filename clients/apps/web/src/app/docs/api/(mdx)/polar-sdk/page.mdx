# Polar SDK

The Polar SDK is a TypeScript library that provides a high-level API for interacting with the Polar platform. The API client is automatically generated from our OpenAPI implementation, making it up-to-date with the server-side API.

## Installation

The SDK is available from NPM. To install it, run:

```bash
pnpm install @polar-sh/sdk
```

### Configuring the Polar Client

In order to make requests with the Polar client, you need to provide an access key in the form of a Bearer token when making your requsts.

You can create personal access tokens in your [Polar settings](https://polar.sh/settings).

```typescript
import { PolarAPI, Configuration } from '@polar-sh/sdk'

const polar = new PolarAPI(
  new Configuration({
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN}`,
    },
  }),
)
```

<BrowserCallout type="CAUTION">
Remember to keep your access token secure and never expose it in client-side code.

If you are using the Polar SDK in a server-side application, you can store your access token in an environment variable and access it using `process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
