      Today, we're thrilled to announce & launch the next chapter of Polar.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creator platform for developers and the open source ecosystem â€“Â built open source (
      <a
        href="https://github.com/polarsource/polar"
      >
        fork us on GitHub
      </a>
      ).
    </p>
    <p>
      Offering you â€“ as a developer â€“Â  a platform on top of your GitHub repositories to:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Build, own & reach your audience through free- and premium posts and newsletters.
      </li>
      <li>
        Offer subscriptions of value-add benefits designed for our ecosystem & built-in to Polar. We'll also handle value-add taxes so you don't have to.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ability to integrate it all on your own docs, sites or services using our API & SDK.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We're also excited to share our updated pricing (it's better for you) and that our team is going to subscribe to open source developers on Polar for $30K in 2024 ðŸŽ‰
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's dive in.

      Subscriptions & Benefits
    </h3>
    <p>
      <img
        alt="Screenshot 2024-01-09 at 10.44.55.png"
        src="https://7vk6rcnylug0u6hg.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Screenshot%202024-01-09%20at%2010.44.55-uy562dyst8J1Hk4QScE5i6DE3Aa2jA.png"
        style="max-width: 100%;"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      You can now setup subscriptions with Polar ðŸš€ They're beautiful & come with some incredibly powerful features beyond what you'd expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Reach your entire audience with free tier(s)
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      You automatically have a built-in - free - tier offering newsletter access to your Public Posts on Polar. Of course, you can edit it to add even more benefits too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enabling your entire audience to subscribe with email-only at first and for you to have one platform to reach them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Paid tiers & managed value-add taxes
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, you can offer paid tiers too that backers can upgrade to seamlessly over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many developers shy away from offering paid services & benefits due to the value-add tax implications. Calculating, capturing & remitting value-add taxes internationally is a crushing overhead for individual developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's why we're incredibly proud to be the merchant of record and handle value-add taxes so you don't have to. Read more about the details 
      <a

      >
        here
      </a>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Unparalleled business offerings
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Open source developers tend to have sponsorship tiers for individual users vs. businesses, but they're all treated the same. Not with Polar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polar has the concept of subscription audiences: Individual vs. Business. Separating them publicly for clarity, but also ensuring benefits are granted to all individual team members of the organization that subscribes ðŸ¤¯
    </p>
    <p>
      Offering unparalleled opportunities and value to subscriptions offered via Polar to businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Powerful, built-in, benefits
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can setup custom benefits with Polar (free text) for maximum flexibility. However, we're going to invest heavily in automating typical benefits offered within our ecosystem. Making it seamless for you to manage & delightful for your backers to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Discord invites (roles/tier) to automating how businesses can setup their logotype & description once and it automatically propagating across your README (PR/SVG) to sites/docs (SDK). Or how about early access to new features, i.e invite to private repositories? Sponsored posts? Just to mention a few ideas in our pipeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first built-in benefit is Posts & Newsletters. Enabling a vital communication channel to an audience you own & can reach fully - regardless of which benefits you offer today or tomorrow.

    <p>
      It's a bit meta, but you're reading a Polar post right now ðŸ˜Ž It's written in markdown, I previewed it easily both on the web & email and I can share it publicly or to paid subscribers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or how about a hybrid? This is a public post, but the below is a section reserved for paid subscribers. You see that by the upgrade module below (don't worry - I only hid "1337" in there :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      1337
    </p>
    <p>
      We love to write & share code too, so of course we support syntax highlighting in Polar Posts.

      Now might be a good time to promote subscribing to our own Polar Posts in the future. So let me embed that nudge easily below.

      You get a personal page on Polar that you can easily promote Posts, Subscriptions & Issue Funding from Day 1: e.g 
      <code>
        polar.sh/polarsource
      </code>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      We don't think it makes any sense to offer customization abilities to our audience; setting up custom color hex codes, templates etc like other creator platforms. Instead, we're building everything on our public API & offering SDKs (JS first - beta). Since we believe you'd rather integrate it directly on your site, docs and/or services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is that the developer page, e.g 
      <code>
        polar.sh/polarsource
      </code>
      , should be a living example of an API/SDK integration that you can cherry-pick components from. We'd love to hear from you and your use case and work together to ensure we support it -

      Pricing
    </h3>
    <p>
      We're incredibly excited to share that we're updating our pricing with this launch. In order to drive even more capital to open source developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving forward, our pricing is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No fixed costs
      </li>
      <li>
        5% + payment & payout fees (Stripe) instead of our former 10% + payment & payout fees.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>
          We'll also cover Stripe fees from our 5% until March 31st, 2024
        </em>
        .
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

      $30K in 2024 from Team Polar
    </h3>
    <p>
      Finally, we're happy to share that we're going to invest $30K of our own to subscribe to open source developers throughout 2024. So don't hesitate to ping @polar_sh on Twitter with your posts to share it with us and we might subscribe :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      How is this funded?
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Birk lost it in 2023 and pledged $30K personally and has $20K left to spend.
      </li>
      <li>
        Polar supports businesses to setup open source allowances for team members (invite-only for now). Polar has an employee benefit of each engineer getting $200/month. We're 4 people so that's $800/month or $9,600/year. 
        <em>
          We're rounding up the rest :-)
        </em>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Phew. That's all. This is our biggest update since launching Polar and a big step towards our long-term vision of building a platform for developers to get more funding to even building independent businesses around their initiatives.

      Let's create a Polar subscription benefit for a GitHub repository
    </h2>
    <p>
      Let's rig it up and see how it works.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Goto 
        <code>
          Subscriptions
        </code>
         in your dashboard and then click 
        <code>
          Edit tier
        </code>
         on your default 
        <strong>
          Free
        </strong>
         tier (for newsletters) to try it out
      </li>
      <li>
        Click 
        <code>
          New Benefit
        </code>
         (See below)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <img
        alt="Create new benefit"

        style="max-width: 100%;"
      />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Select 
        <code>
          GitHub Repository Access
        </code>
         as the benefit type
      </li>
      <li>
        Select the 
        <code>
          Organization
        </code>
         the private repository belongs to or connect an organization (See notes below)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Why organization vs. personal account?
      </strong>
       GitHub limits personal accounts to only invite collaborators without controlling their permissions, e.g committing to 
      <code>
        main
      </code>
      , pushing new releases etc. Organizations can set more restrictive permissions, e.g read-only. Therefore, due to the security risks, we've put support for personal accounts with this benefit behind a feature flag - reach out if you want it enabled anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Important pricing note:
      </strong>
       Collaborators are considered a seat on paid plans and you'll be billed accordingly. We therefore request read-only access to your organizations billing plan to warn about this in our UI so that you can price your Polar subscription to cover it.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Click 
        <code>
          Install
        </code>
         to install the required Polar GitHub App
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <img

        style="max-width: 100%;"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll be redirected to the GitHub App installation flow to grant access to select repositories. You can choose one of them, a select few or all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Important note:
      </strong>
       Selected repositories here are not automatically granted to subscribers on Polar. You'll explicitly select the one (1) desired repository to grant access to for the given subscription benefit you create on Polar. You're in complete control. Of course, you can create multiple benefits to grant access to numerous repositories, but they're all added explicitly.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>
        Bonus: The Polar GitHub App will also enable you to use the issue crowdfunding & contributor rewards features with Polar too ðŸ”¥. They require read/write to issues & pull requests while administration is required for managing invites to desired GitHub repositories. Unfortunately, GitHub does not offer progressive permissions for Apps.
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the Polar GitHub App has been installed you'll be taken back to Polar to continue the setup of the subscription benefit.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select the private 
        <code>
          Repository
        </code>
         you want to grant subscribers access to
      </li>
      <li>
        Select the desired GitHub 
        <code>
          Role
        </code>
        , e.g 
        <code>
          Read
        </code>
         for read access only.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click 
        <code>
          Create

    </p>
    <p>
      We can now review our updates to the 
      <em>
        Free
      </em>
       tier and see our added GitHub Repository Access benefit we call 
      <code>
        Cutting edge
      </code>
      . We can also update our tier description to celebrate the new benefit.

      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Your audience can now see the benefit and easily subscribe to gain access to it. In case of email subscriptions, we'll prompt them to connect a GitHub account and immediately create the repository invitation once they have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subscribers can see & manage their subscription benefits under 
      <code>
        My Subscriptions
      </code>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at that, they now see the 
      <code>
        Cutting edge
      </code>
       repository with a convenient activation link to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>
        Note: They also receive an email invitation from GitHub.

    <p>
      So let's click the 
      <code>
        Goto polardemo/cutting-edge

       link. Since it's our first time, we're prompted to accept the invitation first.

    <p>
      You can of course review and manage your collaborators on GitHub. As seen above, our subscriber is now a collaborator with 
      <code>
        Read
      </code>
       permissions. Just like we wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, and of course, Polar will automatically remove collaborators once their subscription is no longer valid, i.e cancelled.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In this example, we've setup seamless invitations to one (1) GitHub repository. However, it's the same process to add additional benefits for more repositories. So there's no limit to how creative you can get with your offerings - we can't wait to see some of your examples!
