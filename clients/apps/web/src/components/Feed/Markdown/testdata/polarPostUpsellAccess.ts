## Let's create a Polar subscription benefit for a GitHub repository

Let's rig it up and see how it works.
1. Goto \`Subscriptions\` in your dashboard and then click \`Edit tier\` on your default **Free** tier (for newsletters) to try it out
2. Click \`New Benefit\` (See below)

![Create new benefit](https://7vk6rcnylug0u6hg.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/image-ILn7PLAZL2eck6O9rKHCJIO4Nlgd4U.png)

- Select \`GitHub Repository Access\` as the benefit type
- Select the \`Organization\` the private repository belongs to or connect an organization (See notes below)

**Why organization vs. personal account?** GitHub limits personal accounts to only invite collaborators without controlling their permissions, e.g committing to \`main\`, pushing new releases etc. Organizations can set more restrictive permissions, e.g read-only. Therefore, due to the security risks, we've put support for personal accounts with this benefit behind a feature flag - reach out if you want it enabled anyway.

**Important pricing note:** Collaborators are considered a seat on paid plans and you'll be billed accordingly. We therefore request read-only access to your organizations billing plan to warn about this in our UI so that you can price your Polar subscription to cover it.

- Click \`Install\` to install the required Polar GitHub App

![Create benefit - Install GitHub App](https://7vk6rcnylug0u6hg.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/image-h5l5CsSZ3SI7LBg4Mx5fzokNzjpE6S.png)

You'll be redirected to the GitHub App installation flow to grant access to select repositories. You can choose one of them, a select few or all of them.

**Important note:** Selected repositories here are not automatically granted to subscribers on Polar. You'll explicitly select the one (1) desired repository to grant access to for the given subscription benefit you create on Polar. You're in complete control. Of course, you can create multiple benefits to grant access to numerous repositories, but they're all added explicitly.

![GitHub installation flow](https://7vk6rcnylug0u6hg.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/image-0GzjfOkdRqj0QyA07DqFIRstDbsouo.png)

*Bonus: The Polar GitHub App will also enable you to use the issue crowdfunding & contributor rewards features with Polar too ðŸ”¥. They require read/write to issues & pull requests while administration is required for managing invites to desired GitHub repositories. Unfortunately, GitHub does not offer progressive permissions for Apps.*

Once the Polar GitHub App has been installed you'll be taken back to Polar to continue the setup of the subscription benefit.
1. Select the private \`Repository\` you want to grant subscribers access to
2. Select the desired GitHub \`Role\`, e.g \`Read\` for read access only.
3. Click \`Create\`

![Select repository & role](https://7vk6rcnylug0u6hg.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/image-MenUSRBNEXfw5ZmFkt5uP6Ffsh0I3q.png)

We can now review our updates to the *Free* tier and see our added GitHub Repository Access benefit we call \`Cutting edge\`. We can also update our tier description to celebrate the new benefit.

![Review tier](https://7vk6rcnylug0u6hg.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/image-Z1UfL9ilQFHM64fMqIM3G6vI51bNSv.png)

Looks great. Let's click \`Save Tier\` and try it out as a subscriber. 

## Subscribers accessing GitHub repository

![Subscribe](https://7vk6rcnylug0u6hg.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/image-sGIzRl0if9LmJd9lWhaGDpd6bLnsn3.png)

Your audience can now see the benefit and easily subscribe to gain access to it. In case of email subscriptions, we'll prompt them to connect a GitHub account and immediately create the repository invitation once they have.

Subscribers can see & manage their subscription benefits under \`My Subscriptions\`. 

Look at that, they now see the \`Cutting edge\` repository with a convenient activation link to it. 

*Note: They also receive an email invitation from GitHub.*

![Gain access to repo via subscriptions](https://7vk6rcnylug0u6hg.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/image-RxC5k4B9QPNxTGwYZUXhsjpjzKxgEw.png)

So let's click the \`Goto polardemo/cutting-edge\` link. Since it's our first time, we're prompted to accept the invitation first.

![Accept invitation](https://7vk6rcnylug0u6hg.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/image-qyWQF7WGTkld5JzcbZmvAYjibjspE7.png)

... and that's it. We're in! 

![Subscriber seeing the repository on GitHub](https://7vk6rcnylug0u6hg.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/image-RMwsZSbqgWak7MfKjLjLPD8f25U3jq.png)


## Manage collaborators

![image.png](https://7vk6rcnylug0u6hg.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/image-Ihx3RL0EIobi7KlULBBvfeDYleStKA.png)

You can of course review and manage your collaborators on GitHub. As seen above, our subscriber is now a collaborator with \`Read\` permissions. Just like we wanted.

Oh, and of course, Polar will automatically remove collaborators once their subscription is no longer valid, i.e cancelled.

---------------------

In this example, we've setup seamless invitations to one (1) GitHub repository. However, it's the same process to add additional benefits for more repositories. So there's no limit to how creative you can get with your offerings - we can't wait to see some of your examples!

Until next time, keep building!
