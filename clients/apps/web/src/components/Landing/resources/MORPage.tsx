            Most countries, states and jurisdictions globally impose sales taxes
            on digital goods and services (VAT, GST, US Sales Tax etc).
            Regardless of whether the merchant (seller) is a resident there or
            not - they&apos;re doing business there.
          </p>
          <p className="dark:text-polar-300 text-gray-500">
            For example, a $10/month subscription should cost $12.5/month for a
            Swedish (25% VAT) consumer, but $10/month for a Swedish business
            with VAT registration (reverse charge).
          </p>
          <p className="dark:text-polar-300 text-gray-500">
            Merchants are responsible for capturing & remitting sales taxes to
            the local tax authorities. What does that mean in our example?
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
          <h3>Capturing</h3>
          <p className="dark:text-polar-300 text-gray-500">
            Charging the Swedish consumer $12.5/month and saving $2.5/month for
            the Swedish tax authorities. Stripe Tax is an excellent service to
            automate this and the one Polar uses today.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
          <h3>Remitting</h3>
          <p className="dark:text-polar-300 text-gray-500">
            Filing & paying the captured sales taxes with the tax authorities on
            time. Stripe Tax does not do this, i.e the merchant is liable to
            register, file and pay taxes to local tax authorities.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="dark:border-polar-700 flex flex-col gap-2 border-t border-gray-200 pt-4">
          <p className="dark:text-polar-300 text-gray-500">
            Many jurisdictions, however, don&apos;t require this until you reach
            a certain threshold in terms of sales volume. But others require
            registration even before the first sale - or after a very low
            threshold. In addition to having different rates and rules on which
            goods are taxable and whether they&apos;re deductable or not for
            business customers.
          </p>

          <p className="dark:text-polar-300 text-gray-500">
            For example, United Kingdom and EU countries require upfront
            registration for international companies, but Texas (United States)
            does not until you&apos;ve sold for more than $500,000.
          </p>

          <p className="dark:text-polar-300 text-gray-500">
            In short: It&apos;s complex and hard. Even large and well-known
            businesses don&apos;t do it perfectly. Arguably, it&apos;s almost
            impossible and at least highly impracticle and expensive to comply
            perfectly upfront. Many companies even delay compliance as a
            calculated risk, i.e focus on validating & growing their business
            with the risk of paying back taxes + penalities later.
