            You can issue both full or partial refunds on Polar to your
            customers. However, the initial transaction fees are not refunded to
            you since credit card networks and PSPs charge them regardless of a
            future refund.

              Polar reserves the right to issue refunds at our own discretion up
              to 60 days after the purchase as part of our efforts to
              continuously and proactively reduce disputes & chargebacks which
              costs you $15/dispute. We only leverage this right for this
              purpose and in the interest of reducing chargebacks and fees for
              you.

            Sometimes, customers can open a <strong>dispute/chargeback</strong>{' '}
            via their bank for a purchase.{' '}
            <strong>Disputes cost $15 per dispute</strong> regardless of outcome
            and is deducted from your balance directly. This fee is charged by
            the underlying credit card networks & PSPs regardless of outcome and
            therefore something we cannot refund.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, we continuously work to proactively reduce the rate of
            chargebacks across Polar to be at or lower than industry standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Credit card networks impose monitoring programs, penalties and
            higher chargeback costs for sellers with high chargeback rates
            (~0.7%+). Since Polar is the Merchant of Record, we therefore always
            monitor and proactively prevent our rate coming close to these
            thresholds.

            <p className="dark:text-polar-300 text-sm text-gray-500">
              Therefore, we might need to intervene and even suspend your
              account unless swift and proactive measures are taken to reduce
              chargebacks to an acceptable industry standard.
