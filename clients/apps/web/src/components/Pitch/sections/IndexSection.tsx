        <p>
          What used to be a simple way to pay for things has become a complex
          mess.
        </p>
        <p>
          Software as a Service (SaaS) has become the norm, but the underlying
          payment infrastructure has not evolved.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why we are building Polar 2.0, payment infrastructure for the
          21st century.
