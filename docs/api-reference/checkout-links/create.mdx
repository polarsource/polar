<Warning>
  Looking to create a single use checkout session? Checkout Links are probably **not** what you're looking for.

  Checkout Links are shareable links that generate checkout sessions when opened. They are very handy to start a purchase from your website or social media.

  However, if you want to start a checkout for one of your user **inside** your product, you should use the [Checkout Sessions API](/api-reference/checkouts/create-session).
