openapi: post /v1/customer-portal/license-keys/activate
---

<Tip>
You only need to use this endpoint if you have device **activations** enabled on the license key benefit. You then use this endpoint to reserve an allocation for a specific device. Storing the unique activation ID from the response on the device and using it as extra validation in the [`/validate`](/api-reference/customer-portal/license-keys/validate) endpoint.

Not using **activations**? Just use the [`/validate`](/api-reference/customer-portal/license-keys/validate) endpoint directly instead.
