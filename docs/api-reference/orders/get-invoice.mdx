openapi: get /v1/orders/{id}/invoice
---

<Note>
  The invoice must be generated first before it can be retrieved. You should call the [`POST /v1/orders/{id}/invoice`](/api-reference/orders/post-invoice) endpoint to generate the invoice.

If the invoice is not generated, you will receive a `404` error.
