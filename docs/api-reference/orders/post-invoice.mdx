openapi: post /v1/orders/{id}/invoice
---

<Warning>
  Once the invoice is generated, it's permanent and cannot be modified.

Make sure the billing details (name and address) are correct before generating the invoice. You can update them before generating the invoice by calling the [`PATCH /v1/orders/{id}`](/api-reference/orders/patch) endpoint.

</Warning>

<Note>
  After successfully calling this endpoint, you get a `202` response, meaning
  the generation of the invoice has been scheduled. It usually only takes a few
  seconds before you can retrieve the invoice using the [`GET /v1/orders/{id}
  /invoice`](/api-reference/orders/get-invoice) endpoint.

If you want a reliable notification when the invoice is ready, you can listen to the
[`order.updated`](/api-reference/webhooks/order.updated) webhook and check the [`is_invoice_generated` field](/api-reference/webhooks/order.updated#schema-data-is-invoice-generated).

</Note>
