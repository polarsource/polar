Polar API has rate limits to ensure fair usage and maintain performance. The limits are as follows:

- **100 requests per second** per IP address.

If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. The response will include a `Retry-After` header indicating how long you should wait before making another request.
