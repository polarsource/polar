<Update label="2025-03-20">
  ## New order status and webhooks

Until now, Polar only kept track of fully processed, **paid** orders. To help you keep track of the order lifecycle, we've added a new status `pending`, which is a transitive state meaning the order is created but not paid yet. In most cases, the order will transition from `pending` to `paid` in a short time.

- <Icon icon="circle-exclamation" size={16} color="orange" /> When receiving
  `order.created` event, the order status might not be `paid`.
- <Icon icon="check" size={16} color="green" /> **Added**:
  [`order.updated`](/api-reference/webhooks/order.updated) webhook, sent when
  the order status changes or when it's partially or fully refunded.
- <Icon icon="check" size={16} color="green" /> **Added**:
  [`order.paid`](/api-reference/webhooks/order.paid) webhook, sent when the
  order is fully processed and paid.
- <Icon icon="check" size={16} color="green" /> **Added**:
  [`Order.paid`](/api-reference/orders/get#response-paid) property to the order
  schema.

<Info>
  If you were relying on the `order.created` webhook to keep track of succesful
  orders, we recommend you to switch to `order.paid`.

<Update label="2025-03-14">
  ## Subscriptions and Orders schema changes

To prepare our next move to support usage-based billing, we've made some changes to the [`Subscription`](/api-reference/subscriptions/get) and [`Order`](/api-reference/orders/get) schemas. The main reason behind those is that we need to support multiple prices and items in a single subscription or order.

- <Icon icon="circle-exclamation" size={16} color="orange" /> **Deprecated**:
  `Subscription.price_id` and `Subscription.price`. Use the
  `Subscription.prices` array instead.
- <Icon icon="circle-exclamation" size={16} color="orange" /> **Deprecated**:
  `Order.product_price_id` and `Order.product_price`. Use the `Order.items`
  array instead.
- <Icon icon="circle-exclamation" size={16} color="orange" /> **Deprecated**:
  `Order.amount`. Use the `Order.net_amount` instead. It has the same value and
  meaning, but the new name is more explicit.
- <Icon icon="check" size={16} color="green" /> **Added**:
  `Order.subtotal_amount`, `Order.discount_amount`, and `Order.total_amount`
  fields to provide a more detailed breakdown of the order amount.
