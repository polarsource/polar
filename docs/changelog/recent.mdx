<Update label="2025-02-19">
  ## Polar's take on Product variants

  We've released big changes to how we handle products and pricing, allowing us to support a unique approach to what the industry typically calls **variants** ðŸ”¥

  We believe having a single product with multiple pricing models and benefits adds unneccessary complexity to the user and to the API. Instead, we chose to treat everything as a product, giving you maximum flexibility about the pricing and benefits you want to offer.

  Thus, we introduce support for **multiple products** at checkout, allowing customers to switch between them before purchasing. Typically, you can offer a monthly and a yearly product, with specific pricing and benefits for each.

  This is available right now using the [Checkout Session API](/features/checkout/session) and [Checkout Links](/features/checkout/links).

  ### Depreciations

  * Products can no longer have both a monthly and yearly pricing. Existing products still work, but you'll see a warning like this when trying to edit their pricing:

  ### API changes

  * The `product_id` and `product_price_id` fields are deprecated in the [Checkout Session API](/api-reference/checkouts/create-session). You should now use the `products` field to specify the products you want to include in the checkout.
  * The `type` and `recurring_interval` fields on `ProductPrice` are deprecated. `recurring_interval` is now set directly on `Product`.
