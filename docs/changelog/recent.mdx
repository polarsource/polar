<Update label="2025-03-11">
  ## Zapier integration officially launched

We're excited to announce the official launch of our [Zapier integration](https://zapier.com/apps/polar/integrations)! Get started now and connect Polar to 2,000+ other web services.

<Note>
  We've focused on **triggers** (webhooks) for now, so you can react to events in Polar and trigger actions in other apps.

Need to perform actions in Polar? Tell us about your use case [here](https://github.com/orgs/polarsource/discussions/new?category=integrations&labels=integrations%2Fzapier) and we'll consider adding more actions in the future.

  ## Customer State

Maybe one of our neatest features to date! Customer State is a concept allowing you to query for the current state of a customer, including their **active subscriptions** and **granted [benefits](/features/benefits/introduction)**, in a single [API call](/api-reference/customers/state-external) or single [webhook event](/api-reference/webhooks/customer.state_changed).

Combined with the [External ID](/features/customer-management#external-id) feature, you can get up-and-running in minutes.

  ## Better Auth Plugin

Integrating authentication and billing for your users has never been easier.

<img src="/assets/changelog/2025-03-04/better_auth.jpeg" />

[Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) is an open source authentication framework for
TypeScript that is quickly becoming a favorite amongst developers. Today, we're
trilled to have shipped a Polar plugin for Better Auth - in collaboration with them.

Checkout our [integration guide](/integrate/sdk/adapters/better-auth).

  ## Customer External ID

We've added support for an `external_id` field on Customers. We believe this will greatly simplify the reconciliation process between your system and Polar.

Previously, the recommended way to reconcile with your users was to use `metadata`. However, this was not always the most convenient method, especially if you needed to fetch a Customer from our API.

With `external_id`, you can now fetch a Customer directly by their external ID through dedicated `GET`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` endpoints. You don't even need to store Polar's internal ID in your system anymore! [Read more](/features/customer-management#external-id)

Of course, you can also directly preset `customer_external_id` when creating a Checkout Session, and it will automatically be set on the newly created Customer after a successful checkout. [Read more](/features/checkout/session#external-customer-id)

  ## Polar's take on Product variants

We've released big changes to how we handle products and pricing, allowing us to support a unique approach to what the industry typically calls **variants** ðŸ”¥

We believe having a single product with multiple pricing models and benefits adds unneccessary complexity to the user and to the API. Instead, we chose to treat everything as a product, giving you maximum flexibility about the pricing and benefits you want to offer.

Thus, we introduce support for **multiple products** at checkout, allowing customers to switch between them before purchasing. Typically, you can offer a monthly and a yearly product, with specific pricing and benefits for each.

This is available right now using the [Checkout Session API](/features/checkout/session) and [Checkout Links](/features/checkout/links).

### Depreciations

- Products can no longer have both a monthly and yearly pricing. Existing products still work, but you'll see a warning like this when trying to edit their pricing:

</Frame>

### API changes

- The `product_id` and `product_price_id` fields are deprecated in the [Checkout Session API](/api-reference/checkouts/create-session). You should now use the `products` field to specify the products you want to include in the checkout.
- The `type` and `recurring_interval` fields on `ProductPrice` are deprecated. `recurring_interval` is now set directly on `Product`.
