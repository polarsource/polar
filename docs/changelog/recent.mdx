<Update label="2025-09-12">
  ## Webhooks payload now includes timestamp

We've updated our webhooks server implementation to [include a timestamp in each payload](https://github.com/polarsource/polar/pull/6770), in line with the Standard Webhooks specification.

This change ensures that every webhook payload contains precise event timing, making it easier to trace and debug webhook deliveries, and to meet integration requirements for external platforms.

  ## Meter management improvements

We've made it easier to manage your meters with new UI functionality for archiving and unarchiving meters directly from the dashboard.

You can now archive meters that are no longer needed, which helps keep your meter list organized. Archived meters can be unarchived if you need to use them again. Note that meters cannot be archived if they are still attached to active products or referenced by active benefits.

  ## Metrics accuracy improvements

We've improved the accuracy of our metrics by excluding unpaid orders from all calculations. Previously, orders in pending status were included in metrics, which could lead to inflated numbers.

Now, only successfully paid and refunded orders are included in metrics calculations, giving you a more accurate view of your actual business performance.

  ## Enhanced customer email branding

We've improved the branding of emails sent to your customers by using organization-specific 'From' and 'Reply-to' addresses.

Customer emails now appear to come from your organization (e.g., "YourOrg (via Polar)") with replies directed to your organization's email address, providing a more professional and branded experience for your customers.

</Update>

<Update label="2025-06-12">
  ## Update subscription discount

We've added the ability to update the discount on a subscription. This allows you to add, remove, or change the discount applied to a subscription at any time.

This feature is both available through the [API](/api-reference/subscriptions/update) and the dashboard.

</Update>

<Update label="2025-06-05">
  ## Payout Reverse Invoices

We've added the ability to generate reverse invoices for payouts directly from the Payouts page. This feature allows you to easily create an invoice that details the sales made on your behalf, minus our fees.

</Update>

<Update label="2025-05-22">
  ## Business Purchase Option on Checkout

We've added a new "I'm purchasing as a business" checkbox to the Checkout flow. When selected, customers are required to provide their business billing name and complete billing address.

</Update>

<Update label="2025-05-19">
  ## Enhanced Attribution for Checkout Links

We've added support for `reference_id` and UTM parameters (`utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, `utm_term`) as query parameters for Checkout Links. These parameters are automatically stored in the Checkout metadata, allowing you to track the source of your traffic and conversions more effectively.

</Update>

<Update label="2025-05-15">
  ## Checkouts and payments insights

We've added a new **Checkouts** tab under the **Sales**, where you can review all the checkout sessions, successful or not. You can filter them by customer email, status, and product. You can also see the payment attempts for each checkout session, including the reason for any failed or declined payments.

The payment attempts information is also available on each order.

Besides, we've also added new analytics around checkouts: total number of checkouts, successful checkouts, and conversion rate.

</Update>

<Update label="2025-03-11">
  ## Zapier integration officially launched

We're excited to announce the official launch of our [Zapier integration](https://zapier.com/apps/polar/integrations)! Get started now and connect Polar to 2,000+ other web services.

<Note>
  We've focused on **triggers** (webhooks) for now, so you can react to events in Polar and trigger actions in other apps.

Need to perform actions in Polar? Tell us about your use case [here](https://github.com/orgs/polarsource/discussions/new?category=integrations&labels=integrations%2Fzapier) and we'll consider adding more actions in the future.

</Note>

<Update label="2025-03-05">
  ## Customer State

Maybe one of our neatest features to date! Customer State is a concept allowing you to query for the current state of a customer, including their **active subscriptions** and **granted [benefits](/features/benefits/introduction)**, in a single [API call](/api-reference/customers/state-external) or single [webhook event](/api-reference/webhooks/customer.state_changed).

Combined with the [External ID](/features/customer-management#external-id) feature, you can get up-and-running in minutes.

  ## Better Auth Plugin

Integrating authentication and billing for your users has never been easier.

<img src="/assets/changelog/2025-03-04/better_auth.jpeg" />

[Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) is an open source authentication framework for
TypeScript that is quickly becoming a favorite amongst developers. Today, we're
thrilled to have shipped a Polar plugin for Better Auth - in collaboration with them.

Checkout our [integration guide](/integrate/sdk/adapters/better-auth).

</Update>

<Update label="2025-02-27">
  ## Customer External ID

We've added support for an `external_id` field on Customers. We believe this will greatly simplify the reconciliation process between your system and Polar.

Previously, the recommended way to reconcile with your users was to use `metadata`. However, this was not always the most convenient method, especially if you needed to fetch a Customer from our API.

With `external_id`, you can now fetch a Customer directly by their external ID through dedicated `GET`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` endpoints. You don't even need to store Polar's internal ID in your system anymore! [Read more](/features/customer-management#external-id)

Of course, you can also directly preset `external_customer_id` when creating a Checkout Session, and it will automatically be set on the newly created Customer after a successful checkout. [Read more](/features/checkout/session#external-customer-id)

</Update>

<Update label="2025-02-19">
  ## Polar's take on Product variants

We've released big changes to how we handle products and pricing, allowing us to support a unique approach to what the industry typically calls **variants** 🔥

We believe having a single product with multiple pricing models and benefits adds unneccessary complexity to the user and to the API. Instead, we chose to treat everything as a product, giving you maximum flexibility about the pricing and benefits you want to offer.

Thus, we introduce support for **multiple products** at checkout, allowing customers to switch between them before purchasing. Typically, you can offer a monthly and a yearly product, with specific pricing and benefits for each.

{" "}

/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/assets/features/checkout/session/checkout_multiple_products.dark.png"
/>

This is available right now using the [Checkout Session API](/features/checkout/session) and [Checkout Links](/features/checkout/links).

### Depreciations

- Products can no longer have both a monthly and yearly pricing. Existing products still work, but you'll see a warning like this when trying to edit their pricing:

  />
</Frame>

### API changes

- The `product_id` and `product_price_id` fields are deprecated in the [Checkout Session API](/api-reference/checkouts/create-session). You should now use the `products` field to specify the products you want to include in the checkout.
- The `type` and `recurring_interval` fields on `ProductPrice` are deprecated. `recurring_interval` is now set directly on `Product`.
