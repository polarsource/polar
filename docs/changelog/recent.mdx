<Update label="2025-02-27">
  ## Customer External ID

We've added support for an `external_id` field on Customers. We believe this will greatly simplify the reconciliation process between your system and Polar.

Previously, the recommended way to reconcile with your users was to use `metadata`. However, this was not always the most convenient method, especially if you needed to fetch a Customer from our API.

With `external_id`, you can now fetch a Customer directly by their external ID through dedicated `GET`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` endpoints. You don't even need to store Polar's internal ID in your system anymore! [Read more](/features/customer-management#external-id)

Of course, you can also directly preset `customer_external_id` when creating a Checkout Session, and it will automatically be set on the newly created Customer after a successful checkout. [Read more](/features/checkout/session#external-customer-id)

  ## Polar's take on Product variants

We've released big changes to how we handle products and pricing, allowing us to support a unique approach to what the industry typically calls **variants** ðŸ”¥

We believe having a single product with multiple pricing models and benefits adds unneccessary complexity to the user and to the API. Instead, we chose to treat everything as a product, giving you maximum flexibility about the pricing and benefits you want to offer.

Thus, we introduce support for **multiple products** at checkout, allowing customers to switch between them before purchasing. Typically, you can offer a monthly and a yearly product, with specific pricing and benefits for each.

This is available right now using the [Checkout Session API](/features/checkout/session) and [Checkout Links](/features/checkout/links).

### Depreciations

- Products can no longer have both a monthly and yearly pricing. Existing products still work, but you'll see a warning like this when trying to edit their pricing:

### API changes

- The `product_id` and `product_price_id` fields are deprecated in the [Checkout Session API](/api-reference/checkouts/create-session). You should now use the `products` field to specify the products you want to include in the checkout.
- The `type` and `recurring_interval` fields on `ProductPrice` are deprecated. `recurring_interval` is now set directly on `Product`.
