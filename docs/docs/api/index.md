# Polar API Documentation (Alpha)

Polar has a [API](https://api.polar.sh/redoc) for integrating Polar with anything imaginable, from websites to Discord bots.

All of the public websites on Polar, like `polar.sh/polarsource` are built using our Public APIs ([example](https://github.com/polarsource/polar/blob/main/clients/apps/web/src/pages/%5Borganization%5D/index.tsx)).

* [Documentation](https://api.polar.sh/redoc)
* [OpenAPI Schema](https://api.polar.sh/openapi.json)

To access private data, you'll need to use a Personal Access Token to authenticate yourself with the API. You can get one from [`polar.sh/settings`](https://polar.sh/settings).
