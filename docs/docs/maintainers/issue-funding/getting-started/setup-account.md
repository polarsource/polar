This signup flow will ensure you:

1. Create a Polar account using your GitHub Login (OAuth)

    *Covered in the next section below.*

2. Install the Polar GitHub app thereafter (redirect) - granting access to
   select repositories to use with Polar for issue funding.

    *Covered on the next page: [Install GitHub App](/maintainers/issue-funding/getting-started/app-installation)*


### GitHub Login (OAuth) Permissions

Signup & login on Polar is made super easy with GitHub Login (OAuth).

We require GitHub Login (OAuth) for maintainer accounts on Polar. In order to:

- Verify your GitHub account
- Install & manage the Polar GitHub app (next step) to enable funding towards
issues across your select repositories.

We also use this login connection to:

- Reserve the same username/orgname on Polar
- Request read-only access to your email addresses so we can communicate with
  you, e.g send notifications upon new pledges etc.
- Create a matching, public, profile for you on Polar (avatar, username, bio etc)
- Setup a public page under `https://polar.sh/<username>` for maintainers -
  showing fundable issues
- Show your profile in connection with funding issues (optional)
- Recommend maintainers/repositories to fund based on your GitHub stars

Once authorization has been granted, you will be redirect to GitHub again to
[install the Polar GitHub app](/maintainers/issue-funding/getting-started/app-installation) on the
repositories you want.

???+ question "What does 'Act on my behalf' mean?"
    Unfortunately, this is a default notice - poorly explained - from GitHub in all their OAuth
    authentication flows. [See this ticket from the wider community asking GitHub to improve
    the copy.](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/37117b)

    Rest assured, we do not do anything on your behalf without a delibrate action
    performed by you via Polar for an explicit, clear & desired outcome by you.

    Specifically, we make it easy for you - as a maintainer - to comment on issues
    you manage via Polar. In case you want to promote funding or notify
    contributors about granted rewards via an in-line comment. No such comment
    is automated, required or hard-coded (you can edit them freely in our UI) and they
    require you to manually submit them each time.
