# Issue Funding

Polar offers a seamless service to enable your community to pool
funding towards issues - helping support, upvote and fund the most impactful
efforts. You can also easily reward contributors a share of the funding once the
issue is completed.

## Features
Polar is designed for maintainers, not bounty hunters. You remain in complete
control & can get a better backlog based on reactions & funding from across your
community.

* Enable users to easily fund any issues (feature requests, roadmap items, bugs
  etc)
* Seamless embedding of the Polar badge on GitHub issues to promote funding for
  select issues
* Set individual funding goals per issue (or leave it open)
* Funding is pooled from community members & users
* Better backlog of issues stack ranked based on reactions & funding
* Reward contributors once issues are completed a percentage of received funding
* Set & promote an upfront reward (% of funding) to contributors (optional)
* Seed the reward easily yourself if you have capital to spare (optional)

## Pricing
