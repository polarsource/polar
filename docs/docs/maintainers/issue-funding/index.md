# Issue Funding

Polar offers a seamless service to enable your community to pool
funding towards issues - helping support, upvote and fund the most impactful
efforts. You can also easily reward contributors a share of the funding once the
issue is completed.

## Reward Contributors

Issue funding can seamlessly be shared with your contributors. You can think of
rewards as open source bounties, but don't worry  - it's designed for
maintainers and your communities for a change.

- You are in full control
- Your community pools funding towards an issue
- You can [promote funding towards specific
  issues](/maintainers/issue-funding/workflow)
- You can split the funding with contributor(s), i.e reward them
- You can promote rewards publicly (Optional - more details below)
- You can adjust rewards & add custom recipients when marking an issue as
  completed
- Your GitHub issue thread stays focused on making progress vs. funding chatter

You can read more about our philosophy of empowering maintainers & their
communities with Polar Rewards in our original [blog post from the Rewards launch](https://blog.polar.sh/introducing-rewards/).
