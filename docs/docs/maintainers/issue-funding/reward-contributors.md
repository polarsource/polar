# Reward Contributors

You can think of rewards as open source bounties, but don't worry  - it's designed for
maintainers and your communities for a change.

- You are in full control
- Your community pools funding towards an issue
- You can [promote funding towards specific
  issues](/maintainers/issue-funding/workflow)
- You can split the funding with contributor(s), i.e reward them
- You can promote rewards publicly (Optional - more details below)
- You can adjust rewards & add custom recipients when marking an issue as
  completed
- Your GitHub issue thread stays focused on making progress vs. funding chatter

You can read more about our philosophy of empowering maintainers & their
communities with Polar Rewards in our original [blog post from the Rewards launch](https://blog.polar.sh/introducing-rewards/).

## Promote Rewards (Optional)

Polar makes it easy to setup & promote an upfront reward to
potential contributors within your community.

Your public contributor reward (% of funding) is then shown upfront:

- In the Polar Badge
- On the funding page for the issue
- On your Polar page, e.g `https://polar.sh/{your-username/orgname}`

Optimized to be shown within your existing community and with the right
incentives. Combined with giving you complete control of how to promote it more
broadly, e.g community Discord server, social media etc.

Instead of a public directory of bounties attracting the wrong incentives &
drive-by contributors of varying quality.

**Setup & Customize Public Rewards**

1. [Open the badge customization
   modal](/maintainers/issue-funding/workflow/#customize) for the desired issue and goto the
   `Rewards` tab.
2. Switch the `Public rewards` toggle to on (highlighted in blue)
3. Customize the split in percentage you want to allocate to contributor(s) vs.
   yourself

    *Default is 50/50, but you can offer contributors anything from 1% to 100%.
    Did you end up doing everything yourself? Don't worry, you can adjust this
    once the issue is completed before payouts.*

You're done. Changes are saved automatically.

**Boost reward**

Have some prior funding you want to offer yourself to contributors? You can
easily make your own pledge in the modal (invoice sent once issue is completed).
This is by no means required, but a nice utility in the toolbox for those who
want it.

1. Enter the funding amount in USD you want to pledge yourself
2. Click `Pledge`

## Granting Rewards

Rewards can be shared once an issue has been marked as completed.
