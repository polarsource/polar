You can add a simple, custom benefit, which allows you to attach a note to paying customers.

**Custom Notes**
-----------------------

Secret message only customers can see, e.g [Cal.com](http://Cal.com) link, private email for support etc.

For custom integrations you can also distinguish benefits granted to customers to offer even more bespoke user benefits.

<Note>
  Previously, we recommended using a Custom benefit without a note as a way to
  grant access to software or SaaS features — decoupling entitlements from
  checking directly on products. We now recommend the
  [Feature Flag](/features/benefits/feature-flags) benefit for this purpose, as
  it's purpose-built for feature gating and supports key-value metadata.
