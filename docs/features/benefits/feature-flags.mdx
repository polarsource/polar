The Feature Flag benefit is a lightweight way to grant feature access to customers without any external service integration. If a customer has the benefit grant, they have access — it's that simple.

## Use Cases

* Gate premium features behind a subscription tier
* Offer early access or beta features to select customers
* Differentiate access levels across product tiers
* Control API rate limit tiers or usage quotas in your application

## Create Feature Flag Benefit

1. Go to `Benefits` in the sidebar
2. Click `+ New Benefit` to create a new benefit
3. Choose `Feature Flag` as the `Type`
4. Give it a short description (e.g. "Premium Features" or "Beta Access")

### Metadata

You can optionally attach key-value metadata to a feature flag benefit. This is useful for passing additional context to your application, for example:

* `role` → `editor`
* `max_upload_size` → `10`
* `priority` → `elevated`

Metadata can be configured when creating or editing the benefit in the dashboard using the **Add Metadata** button.

## Integration

The recommended way to check if a customer has a feature flag benefit is through the [Customer State](/integrate/customer-state) API or the [`customer.state_changed`](/api-reference/webhooks/customer.state_changed) webhook.

The customer state object includes all granted benefits. Simply check if the customer has a benefit grant for your feature flag benefit to determine access.

### Lifecycle

* **Subscriptions**: The feature flag is granted at the start of each subscription cycle and automatically revoked when the subscription is cancelled.
* **One-time purchases**: The feature flag is granted at the time of purchase with lifetime access.
