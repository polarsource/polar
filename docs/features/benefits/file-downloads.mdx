Sell Digital Products
----------------------------

You can easily offer customers and subscribers access to downloadable files with Polar.

* Up to 10GB per file
* Upload any type of file - from ebooks to full-fledged applications
* SHA-256 checksum validation throughout for you and your customers (if desired)
* Customers get a signed & personal downloadable URL

Create Downloadable Benefit
----------------------------------

1. Go to `Benefits` in the Dashboard sidebar
2. Click `+ Add Benefit` to create a new benefit
3. Choose `File Downloads` as the `Type`

You can now upload the files you want to offer as downloadables for customers.

1. Drag & drop files to the dropzone (`Feed me some bytes`)
2. Or click on that area to open a file browser

### Change filename

Click on the filename to change it inline.

### Change order of files

You can drag and drop the files in the order you want.

### Review SHA-256 checksum

Click on the contextual menu dots and then `Copy SHA-256 Checksum`

### Delete a file

Click on the contextual menu dots and then `Delete` in the menu.



**Active subscribers & customers will lose access too!**

Deleting a file permanently deletes it from Polar and our S3 buckets except for the metadata. Disable the file instead if you don't want it permanently deleted.



### Disable & Enable Files

You can disable files at any point to prevent new customers getting access to it.



**Existing customers retain their access**

Customers who purchased before the file was disabled will still have access to legacy files. Only new customers will be impacted.




**Enabling or adding files grants access retroactively**

In case you add more files or re-enable existing ones, all current customers and subscribers with the benefit will be granted access.
