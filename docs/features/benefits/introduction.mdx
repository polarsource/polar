* [**GitHub Repository Access**](/features/benefits/github-access). Automatically invite subscribers to private GitHub repo(s).
* [**Discord Invite**](/features/benefits/discord-access). Automate invitations and granting of roles to subscribers and customers.


Product & Subscription Benefits
--------------------------------------

Product and subscription benefits are standalone resources in Polar - connected to one or many products or subscription tiers.

This approach is a bit different from other platforms, but offers many advantages:

* Easy to enable the same benefit across multiple products & subscriptions
* You can change a benefit in one place vs. many
* No duplicate data or work (error prone)
* More intuitive UI for you and your customers

**How customers get access to benefits:**

* ✅ Active subscribers of tiers with the benefit enabled
* ✅ Customers who bought a product with the benefit (lifetime access)
* ❌ Subscribers with an expired subscription (cancelled)
* ❌ Users who are not customers

Creating & Managing Benefits
-----------------------------------

You can manage benefits in two ways:

1. Directly within a product create/edit form
2. Or via `Benefits` in your dashboard
