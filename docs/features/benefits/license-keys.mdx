You can easily sell software license keys with Polar without having to deal with sales tax or hosting an API to validate them in real-time. License keys with Polar come with a lot of powerful features built-in.

* Brandable prefixes, e.g `POLAR_*****`
* Automatic expiration after `N` days, months or years
* Limited number of user activations, e.g devices
* Custom validation conditions
* Usage quotas per license key
* Automatic revokation upon cancelled subscriptions

Create License Key Benefit
---------------------------------

1. Go to `Benefits` in the sidebar
2. Click `+ New Benefit` to create a new benefit
3. Choose `License Keys` as the `Type`

### Custom Branding

Make your license keys standout with brandable prefixes, e.g `MYAPP_<AUTO_GENERATED_UUID4>`

### Automatic Expiration

Want license keys to expire automatically after a certain time period from when the customer bought them? No problem.

### Activation Limits

You can require license keys to be activated before future validation. A great feature in case you want to limit license key usage to a certain number of devices, IPs or other conditions.

**Enable user to deactivate instances via Polar.** Instead of building your own custom admin for customers to manage their activation instances - leave it to Polar instead.

### Usage Limit

Offering OpenAI tokens or anything else with a variable usage cost? You can set a custom usage quota per license key and increment usage upon validation.

Customer Experience
--------------------------

Once customers buy your product or subscribes to your tier, they will automatically receive a unique license key. It's easily accessible to them under their purchases page.

Customers can:

* View & copy their license key
* See expiration date (if applicable)
* See usage left (if applicable)
* Deactivate activations (if enabled)

Integrate API
--------------------

It's super easy and straightforward to integrate Polar license keys into your application, library or API.

### Activate License Keys (Optional)

In case you've setup license keys to have a maximum amount of activation instances, e.g user devices. You'll then need to create an activation instance prior to validating license keys / activation.

**No activation limit?** You can skip this step.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.polar.sh/v1/customer-portal/license-keys/activate
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-d '{
  "key": "1C285B2D-6CE6-4BC7-B8BE-ADB6A7E304DA",
  "organization_id": "fda84e25-7b55-4d67-916d-60ead04ff61f",
  "label": "hello",
  "conditions": { "major_version": 1 },
  "meta": { "ip": "84.19.145.194" }
}'
```

<ParamField path="key" type="string" required>

<ParamField path="organization_id" type="string" required>

### Validate License Keys

For each session of your premium app, library or API, we recommend you validate the users license key via the 
[`/v1/customer-portal/license-keys/validate`](/api-reference/customer-portal/license-keys/validate) endpoint.

  "conditions": { "major_version": 1 },
  "increment_usage": 15
}'
```

Validate `benefit_id` in case of multiple license keys

We require `organization_id` to be provided to avoid cases of Polar license keys being used across Polar organizations erroneously. Otherwise, a valid license key for one organization could be used on another.However, you are required to validate and scope license keys more narrowly within your organization if necessary. Offering more than one type of license key? Be sure to validate their unique benefit\_id in the responses.
