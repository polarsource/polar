You can either copy and paste our code snippet to get up and running in a second or use our JavaScript library for more advanced integrations.

## Code Snippet

The code snippet can be used on any website or CMS that allows you to insert HTML.

First, create a [Checkout Link](/features/checkout/links) as described in the previous section. The code snippet can directly be copied from there by clicking on `Copy Embed Code`.

The snippet looks like this:

```typescript
<a
  href="__CHECKOUT_LINK__"
  data-polar-checkout
  data-polar-checkout-theme="light"
>
  Purchase
</a>
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@polar-sh/checkout@0.1/dist/embed.global.js"
  defer
  data-auto-init
></script>
```

This will display a `Purchase` link which will open an inline checkout when clicked.

You can style the trigger element any way you want, as long as you keep the `data-polar-checkout` attribute.

## Import Library

If you have a more advanced project in JavaScript, like a React app, adding the `<script>` tag may not be an option. In this case, you can install our dedicated library.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm install @polar-sh/checkout
  ```
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add @polar-sh/checkout
  ```
  ```bash yarn
  yarn add @polar-sh/checkout
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Then, you should import the `PolarEmbedCheckout` helper class and manually call `PolarEmbedCheckout.init()`. This will add the required handlers on elements having the `data-polar-checkout` attribute.

Here is an example in React:

```ts
import { PolarEmbedCheckout } from '@polar-sh/checkout/embed'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

const PurchaseLink = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    PolarEmbedCheckout.init()
  }, [])

  return (
    <a
      href="__CHECKOUT_LINK__"
      data-polar-checkout
      data-polar-checkout-theme="light"
    >
      Purchase
    </a>
  )
}

export default PurchaseLink
```

<Tip>
  Instead of a Checkout Link, you can also use a [Checkout Session](/features/checkout/session) URL created dynamically from the API.

  For this to work, make sure to set the [`embed_origin`](/api-reference/checkouts/create-session#body-embed-origin) parameter correctly when creating the Checkout Session. For example, if your checkout page is served on the URL ``https://example.com/checkout``, you should set `embed_origin` to `https://example.com`.

## Enabling Wallet Payment Methods (Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.)

By default, wallet payment methods such as Apple Pay and Google Pay are not enabled when embedding our checkout form into your website. For security reasons, your website domain needs to be manually validated.

To enable wallet payment methods on your website, please [email us](mailto:support@polar.sh) with your organization slug and the domain you wish to allow.
