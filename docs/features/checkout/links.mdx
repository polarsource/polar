Checkout links can be shared or linked on your website which automatically
creates a checkout session for customers.

## No-Code Checkout Links

### Creating a Checkout Link

Checkout Links can be created by pressing the "context-menu" button on the Products Overview Page. This will open a modal where you can select price and optionally set a success URL.

<img className="block dark:hidden" src="/assets/features/checkout/links/create.light.png" />
<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/assets/features/checkout/links/create.dark.png" />

You can also optionally set `Metadata`. This is a key-value object allowing you to store additional information which may be useful for you when handling the order. This metadata will be copied to the generated Checkout object and, if the checkout succeeds, to the resulting Order and/or Subscription.

### Using Checkout Links

Add this Checkout Link on your webpage or share to customers.

<img className="block dark:hidden" src="/assets/features/checkout/links/new.light.png" />
<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/assets/features/checkout/links/new.dark.png" />


<Note>
**Important**

Checkout Links will go against our API, and redirect to short-lived Checkout session. This means that the Checkout page the user will end up on, are temporary and expires after a while if no successful purchase is made.

This means that you need to make sure to always use this Checkout Link URL (as shown above). If you mistakenly copy the URL from a Checkout Session, the link will expire.
</Note>


### Checkout Link Parameters
