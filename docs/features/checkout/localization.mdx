  Checkout localization is currently in **beta**. To enable it, turn on the
  feature flag for your organization.

## How it works

When checkout localization is enabled for your organization, the checkout page automatically detects the customer's preferred language from their browser settings and displays the checkout in that language.

This includes translated labels, placeholders, and descriptions for all standard checkout fields.

## Overriding the language via API

You can explicitly set the checkout language by passing the `locale` parameter when creating a checkout session via the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.polar.sh/v1/checkouts/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "product_price_id": "<price_id>",
    "locale": "fr"
  }'
```

When a `locale` is set explicitly, it takes precedence over the browser's language preference.

## Overriding the language via querystring

You can append `?locale=` to any checkout link and that will take precedence over the browser's language preference.

## Supported languages

- English (en) (default)
- Dutch (nl)

The following languages are coming soon:

- Spanish
- French
- Swedish
- German

## Known limitations

During the beta period, localization is scoped to the checkout page itself:

- **Error messages** are displayed in English
- **Transactional emails** (receipts, confirmations) are sent in English
- **Customer portal** is displayed in English
- There is **no language selector** on the checkout page — language is determined automatically from the browser, via the API `locale` parameter or via a querystring `?locale`.
