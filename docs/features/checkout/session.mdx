If you want to integrate more deeply the checkout process with your website or application, you can use our dedicated API.

The first step is to [create a Checkout session](/api-reference/checkouts/create-session). For this you'll need at least your **Product ID**.

You can retrieve your Product ID from Products in your dashboard, click on "context-menu" button in front of your product and click on Copy Product ID.

The API will return you an object containing all the information about the session, including **an URL where you should redirect your customer** so they can complete their order.

## Multiple products

You can create a checkout session with multiple products. This is useful if you want to allow your customers to choose between different products before they checkout.

## SDK examples

Using our SDK, creating a checkout session is quite straightforward.
