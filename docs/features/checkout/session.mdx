If you want to integrate more deeply the checkout process with your website or application, you can use our dedicated API.

The first step is to [create a Checkout session](/api-reference/checkouts/create-session). For this you'll need at least your **Product ID**.

You can retrieve your Product ID from Products in your dashboard, click on "context-menu" button in front of your product and click on Copy Product ID.

The API will return you an object containing all the information about the session, including **an URL where you should redirect your customer** so they can complete their order.

## Multiple products

You can create a checkout session with multiple products. This is useful if you want to allow your customers to choose between different products before they checkout.

## SDK examples

Using our SDK, creating a checkout session is quite straightforward.


<CodeGroup>
    ```ts TypeScript
    import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

    const polar = new Polar({
      accessToken: process.env["POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN"] ?? "",
    });

    async function run() {
      const checkout = await polar.checkouts.create({
        products: ["productId"]
      });

      console.log(checkout.url)
    }

    run();
    ```

    ```py Python
    from polar_sdk import Polar

    with Polar(
        access_token="<YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE>",
    ) as polar:

        checkout = polar.checkouts.create(request={
            "allow_discount_codes": True,
            "product_id": "<value>",
        })

        print(checkout.url)
    ```
