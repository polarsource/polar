If you want to integrate more deeply the checkout process with your website or application, you can use our dedicated API.

The first step is to [create a Checkout session](/api-reference/checkouts/create-session). For this you'll need at least your **Product ID**.

You can retrieve your Product ID from Products in your dashboard, click on "context-menu" button in front of your product and click on Copy Product ID.

The API will return you an object containing all the information about the session, including **an URL where you should redirect your customer** so they can complete their order.

TypeScript Example
-------------------------

Using our TypeScript SDK, creating a checkout session is quite straight forward.

```typescript
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

const polar = new Polar({
  accessToken: process.env["POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN"] ?? "",
});

async function run() {
  const checkout = await polar.checkouts.custom.create({
    productId: "<value>",
  });

  redirect(checkout.url)
}

run();
```
