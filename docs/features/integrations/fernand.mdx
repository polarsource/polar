## What is Fernand?

[Fernand](https://getfernand.com/) is a modern customer support tool designed for SaaS — it’s fast, calm, and built to reduce the anxiety of answering support requests.

## How it works

After connecting your [Polar](https://polar.sh/) account to Fernand, you’ll be able to see customer payment information and product access details directly within each customer conversation.

This enables you to:

- Instantly verify if someone is an active customer
- Prioritize conversations from high-tier plans
- View product purchases and payment history in context

## How to automate your inbox with Polar data

Once Polar is connected, you can create automation rules in Fernand based on Polar data.

Let’s walk through a basic example: auto-replying to all customers on your `Pro` plan.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a condition">
    Now add a condition based on Polar data. For example:

    - `Contact is a customer...`
    - `Contact has paid plan...`

    You can target specific plans (e.g. `Pro`, `Business`) or specific products to personalize support or automate prioritization.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select an action">
    Now define what happens when the rule matches. For example:
    - Send an auto reply (with variables)
    - Assign the conversation to a specific agent
    - Tag the conversation with `priority` or `paid`
    - Trigger a webhook for external automation
