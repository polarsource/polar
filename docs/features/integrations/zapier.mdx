[Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/polar/integrations) lets you connect Polar to 2,000+ other web services. Automated connections called Zaps, set up in minutes with no coding, can automate your day-to-day tasks and build workflows between apps that otherwise wouldn't be possible.

Each Zap has one app as the **Trigger**, where your information comes from and which causes one or more **Actions** in other apps, where your data gets sent automatically.

<Note>
  We've focused on **triggers** (webhooks) for now, so you can react to events in Polar and trigger actions in other apps.

Need to perform actions in Polar? Tell us about your use case [here](https://github.com/orgs/polarsource/discussions/new?category=integrations&labels=integrations%2Fzapier) and we'll consider adding more actions in the future.
