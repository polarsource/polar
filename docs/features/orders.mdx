You can also have an overview of all checkout sessions. You can filter them by customer email, status and product.

A checkout can be in the following states:

- Open: The checkout session is open and waiting for the customer to complete the payment.
- Confirmed: The customer clicked the **Pay** or **Subscribe** button and the payment is being processed.
- Succeeded: The payment was successful and the order was created.
- Expired: The checkout session expired and the customer can no longer complete it. A new checkout session must be created.

If you click on a Checkout, you can have more details on the **payment attempts**, in particular, why a payment has failed or has been declined.
