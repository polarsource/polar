<Note>
**Everything is a product**

Subscriptions or pay once products are both considered a product in Polar (API & data model). Just with different pricing & billing logic. So both are shown & managed under Products with the ability to filter based on pricing model.

Name & Description
-------------------------

Starting off with the basic.

* **Name.** The title of your product.
* **Description.** Markdown is supported here too.

Pricing
--------------

How much you want to charge and with what frequency (once or recurring).

### Pay Once 

* Price which will be charged upon checkout
* Price is exclusive from tax

### Subscription

* You can `Add yearly pricing` (Annual billing upfront)
* You can remove monthly pricing too if you only want annual billing

### Pay what you want

* You can set a minimum amount
* Set a default amount which will be preselected on checkout

Product Media
--------------------

* You can upload public product images to be displayed on product pages
* They can be up to 10MB each
* You can remove and re-arrange images

Automated Entitlements
-----------------------------

Finally, we can enable or create new entitlements (what we call Benefits) that we tie to the product.

Read more in our [product benefits guide](/features/benefits/introduction) on how they work and how to customize the built-in ones we offer:

* License Keys
* Discord Server Role
* GitHub Repository Access
* File Downloads
* Custom Benefit
