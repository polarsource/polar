title: "Seat-Based Pricing"
description: "Sell team products with assignable seats and tiered pricing"
---

Seat-based pricing allows you to sell products where a billing manager purchases a specific number of seats and can assign them to team members. Each seat holder gets their own access to the product benefits, making it perfect for team subscriptions, perpetual licenses, and multi-user products.

<Info>
**Seat-based pricing is ideal for:**

- Team subscriptions where one billing manager pays for multiple users
- Perpetual team licenses with one-time payment
- Organizational licenses with per-seat pricing
- Products with volume-based tiering (e.g., \$10/seat for 1-4 seats, \$9/seat for 5+)
</Info>

<Warning>
Seat-based pricing is currently in **private beta**. Contact our support team to enable it for your organization.
</Warning>

## How it works

With seat-based pricing, a billing manager purchases a product (subscription or one-time) with a specific number of seats. They can then:

1. **Assign seats** to team members via email or external customer ID
2. **Manage seats** by resending invitations or revoking access
3. **Scale up** by purchasing additional seats (or a new order for one-time products)
4. **Track usage** by viewing which seats are claimed, pending, or available

Team members receive an invitation email with a claim link. Once they claim their seat, benefits are automatically granted.

### Subscriptions vs One-Time Purchases

| Feature | Subscriptions | One-Time Purchases |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Payment** | Recurring (monthly/yearly) | Single payment |
| **Seat Duration** | Active while subscribed | Perpetual (never expire) |
| **Adding Seats** | Modify subscription | Purchase new order |
| **Benefits** | While subscription active | Forever after claim |

<Tip>
Use **subscriptions** for ongoing team access. Use **one-time purchases** for perpetual team licenses.
</Tip>

## Creating a seat-based product

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new product">
    From your dashboard, navigate to Products and click **Create Product**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure basic settings">
    Set your product name, description, and media as usual.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select seat-based pricing">
    Under **Pricing**, select:
    - **Product type**: Subscription or One-time
    - **Billing cycle** (subscriptions only): Monthly or Yearly
    - **Pricing type**: Seat-based
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure seat tiers">
    Define your pricing tiers based on seat quantity:

    - **Min seats**: Minimum number of seats required to purchase
    - **Tiers**: For each tier, set:
      - **Max seats**: Upper limit for this tier (leave empty for unlimited)
      - **Price per seat**: Amount charged per seat in this tier (in cents)

    Seat-based pricing uses **volume pricing** — the per-seat price is determined by the total number of seats purchased, and that rate applies to all seats. For example, if your tiers are:
    - 1-4 seats: $10/seat per month
    - 5-9 seats: $9/seat per month
    - 10+ seats: $8/seat per month

    A purchase of 6 seats would cost 6 × $9 = $54/month (all seats at the 5-9 tier rate).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add benefits">
    Configure the benefits that seat holders will receive. These are only granted when a seat is claimed, not when purchased.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Unlike standard subscriptions, seat-based products **do not grant benefits to the billing manager**. Benefits are only granted to team members who claim their assigned seats. The billing manager can assign a seat to themselves if they also want to receive benefits — this counts toward the purchased seat total.
</Info>

## Managing seats

After purchase, the billing manager can assign and manage seats from the **Customer Portal** or via the API.

### Seat statuses

- **Pending**: Seat assigned, invitation sent, awaiting claim
- **Claimed**: Seat claimed by team member, benefits granted
- **Revoked**: Seat revoked, benefits removed, can be reassigned

### Key actions

- **Assign seats** by email, external customer ID, or existing Polar customer ID
- **Resend invitations** for pending seats if the link expired (valid for 24 hours)
- **Revoke seats** to remove benefits and free the seat for reassignment

<Warning>
Revoking a seat does **not** issue a refund. The billing manager continues to pay for the total number of seats in their subscription.
</Warning>

## Limitations

- Seats must be assigned individually (no bulk import via dashboard, use API instead)
- Claim links expire after 24 hours
- Billing manager does not receive product benefits
- Maximum of 1,000 seats per subscription
- Metadata limited to 10 keys and 1KB total size per seat
