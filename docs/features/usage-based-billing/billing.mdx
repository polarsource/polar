## Invoicing Customers for Usage

Our Usage Based Billing infrastructure is built to work with Subscription products out of the box.

### Monthly Invoicing

If a customer has a subscription with a monthly billing period, usage is aggregated monthly and invoiced at the end of the month with the rest of the subscription.

### Yearly Invoicing

If a customer has a subscription with a yearly billing period, usage is aggregated yearly and invoiced at the end of the year with the rest of the subscription.
