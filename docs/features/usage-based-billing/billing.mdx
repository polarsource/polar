## Metered Pricing

Metered Pricing is a pricing model where you charge your customers based on the usage of your application.

There are a few different pricing models unique to Usage Based Billing:

- Unit Pricing
- Volume Pricing (Coming soon)

### Unit Pricing

Unit pricing is a simple pricing model where you charge a fixed amount for each unit of usage.

For example:

| Product Meter       | Price per unit |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| `prompt-tokens`     | $0.10          |
| `completion-tokens` | $0.18          |

This means that every unit of `prompt-tokens` consumed by a customer will be charged at \$0.10 and every unit of `completion-tokens` will be charged at \$0.18.

It's a linear pricing model, where the price per unit is fixed.

### Volume Pricing (Coming soon)

Volume pricing is a pricing model where you charge a fixed amount for a certain volume of usage. Volume pricing is not yet available, but will be coming soon.

## Invoicing Customers for Usage

Our Usage Based Billing infrastructure is built to work with Subscription products out of the box.

### Monthly Invoicing

If a customer has a subscription with a monthly billing period, usage is aggregated monthly and invoiced at the end of the month with the rest of the subscription.

### Yearly Invoicing

If a customer has a subscription with a yearly billing period, usage is aggregated yearly and invoiced at the end of the year with the rest of the subscription.

## Customer Portal

Customers can view their estimated charges for each meter in the Customer Portal.
