## Basics

Credits are the perfect way to give your customers a "spending limit" on their Usage Meter balance.

## How Credits Work

When you ingest events into a Usage Meter, customers will be charged for the usage based on the product's pricing model.

However, sometimes you may want to give your customers the ability to pre-pay for usage instead of risk getting a hefty bill at the end of the month.

When you issue Credits to a customer, we first deduct the Credits from their Usage Meter balance. If the Usage Meter balance reaches 0, the customer will be charged for the overage.

### Credits-only spending

To avoid any overage charges, you can set the `Cap Amount` on the Metered Product Pricing model to $0. This will prevent any overage charges.

You can then implement a check against the Customer's Meter to see if the user has a balance or is at risk of "over-spending".

The Credits benefit will credit a customer's Usage Meter balance at different points in time depending on the type of product the benefit is attached to.

### Subscription Products

The customer will be credited the amount of units specified in the benefit at the beginning of every subscription cycle period â€” monthly or yearly.

### One-Time Products

The customer will be credited the amount of units specified in the benefit once at the time of purchase.
