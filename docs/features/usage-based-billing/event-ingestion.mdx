## Ingest events using the Polar SDK

To ingest events, you can use the Polar SDKs.

### TypeScript Example

```typescript
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

const polar = new Polar({
  accessToken: process.env["POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN"] ?? "",
});

await polar.events.ingest({
  events: [
    {
      name: "<value>",
      externalCustomerId: "<id>",
      metadata: {
        key: "value",
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

<Note>
  You are always responsible for checking the balance of your customers' Usage
  Meter. As events always are ingested, we will never prohibit any customer's
  action based on their Usage Meter balance.
</Note>

## Ingestion Strategies

To make it easier to ingest events, we have created a set of ingestion strategies for common event sources.

Learn more about our [Ingestion Strategies](/features/usage-based-billing/ingestion-strategies).

## Good to know

### Events are immutable

Once an event is ingested, it cannot be changed, nor can it be deleted.
