## Event Ingestion

Polar's event ingestion service can be used to track events from your application.
Combined with our usage based billing system, you can create powerful usage based billing models, with the underlying events as the source of truth.

## Ingest events using the Polar SDK

To ingest events, you can use the Polar SDKs.

### TypeScript Example

```typescript
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

const polar = new Polar({
  accessToken: process.env["POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN"] ?? "",
});

async function run() {
  const result = await polar.events.ingest({
    events: [
      {
        name: "<value>",
        organizationId: "1dbfc517-0bbf-4301-9ba8-555ca42b9737",
        customerId: "<value>",
        metadata: {
          key: "value",
        },
      },
      {
        name: "<value>",
        organizationId: "1dbfc517-0bbf-4301-9ba8-555ca42b9737",
        externalCustomerId: "<id>",
        metadata: {
          key: "value",
        },
      },
    ],
  });

  // Handle the result
  console.log(result);
}

run();
```

## Ingestion Strategies

To make it easier to ingest events, we have created a set of ingestion strategies for common event sources.
