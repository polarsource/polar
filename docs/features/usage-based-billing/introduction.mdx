## Overview

Polar has a powerful Usage Based Billing infrastructure that allows you to charge your customers based on the usage of your application.

This is done by ingesting events from your application and then creating Meters that represent the usage of your application.

## Quickstart

Get up and running in 5 minutes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Meter">

    Meters consist of filters and an aggregation function.
    The filter is used to select the events that should be included in the meter and the aggregation function is used to compute the usage.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add metered price to a Product">
    To enable usage based billing for a Product, you need to add a metered price to the Product. Metered prices are only applicable to Subscription Products.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Ingest Events">

    Now you're ready to ingest events from your application. Sending events which match the meter's filter will increment the meter's usage for the customer.

## Event Ingestion

To ingest events from your application, you can use our [Event Ingestion API](/api-reference/events/ingest).

## Meters

Meters are the core of the Usage Based Billing system. They represent a specific unit of usage of your application.

## Usage Based Pricing

Usage based pricing is a pricing model where you charge your customers based on the usage of your application.

There are 2 different pricing models:

- Unit Pricing
- Volume Pricing (Coming soon)

### Unit Pricing

Unit pricing is a simple pricing model where you charge a fixed amount for each unit of usage.

For example:

| Product Meter       | Price per unit |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| `prompt-tokens`     | $0.10          |
| `completion-tokens` | $0.18          |

This means that every unit of `prompt-tokens` will be charged at $0.10 and every unit of `completion-tokens` will be charged at $0.18.

### Volume Pricing (Coming soon)

Volume pricing is a pricing model where you charge a fixed amount for a certain volume of usage. Volume pricing is not yet available, but will be coming soon.
