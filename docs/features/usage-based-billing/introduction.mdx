## Overview

Polar has a powerful Usage Based Billing infrastructure that allows you to charge your customers based on the usage of your application.

This is done by ingesting events from your application, creating Meters to represent that usage, and then adding metered prices to Products to charge for it.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Meter">
    Meters consist of filters and an aggregation function.
    The filter is used to filter the events that should be included in the meter and the aggregation function is used to compute the usage.

  <Step title="Add metered price to a Product">
    To enable usage based billing for a Product, you need to add a metered price to the Product. Metered prices are only applicable to Subscription Products.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Ingest Events">

    Now you're ready to ingest events from your application. Sending events which match the meter's filter will increment the meter's usage for the customer.
