## Overview

Polar has a powerful Usage Based Billing infrastructure that allows you to charge your customers based on the usage of your application.

## Event Ingestion

To ingest events from your application, you can use our [Event Ingestion API](/api-reference/events/ingest).

## Meters

Meters are the core of the Usage Based Billing system. They represent a specific unit of usage of your application.

## Usage Based Pricing

Usage based pricing is a pricing model where you charge your customers based on the usage of your application.

There are 4 different pricing models:

- Unit Pricing
- Volume Pricing (Coming soon)

### Unit Pricing

Unit pricing is a simple pricing model where you charge a fixed amount for each unit of usage.

### Volume Pricing (Coming soon)

Volume pricing is a pricing model where you charge a fixed amount for a certain volume of usage. Volume pricing is not yet available, but will be coming soon.
