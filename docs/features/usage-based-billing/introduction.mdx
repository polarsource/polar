## Overview

Polar has a powerful Usage Based Billing infrastructure that allows you to charge your customers based on the usage of your application.

This is done by ingesting events from your application and then creating Meters that represent the usage of your application.

## Event Ingestion

To ingest events from your application, you can use our [Event Ingestion API](/api-reference/events/ingest).

## Meters

Meters are the core of the Usage Based Billing system. They represent a specific unit of usage of your application.

### Creating a Meter

To create a Meter, you can use the [Create Meter API](/docs/api/meters#create-meter).

## Usage Based Pricing

Usage based pricing is a pricing model where you charge your customers based on the usage of your application.

There are 4 different pricing models:

- Unit Pricing
- Volume Pricing

### Unit Pricing

Unit pricing is a simple pricing model where you charge a fixed amount for each unit of usage.

### Volume Pricing

Volume pricing is a pricing model where you charge a fixed amount for a certain volume of usage.
