## Create a Custom Benefit

<Steps>
    <Step title = "Go to Benefits">
        In the Polar dashboard sidebar, click on **Benefits**.

        You can also go directly to `https://polar.sh/dashboard/${org_slug}/products/benefits`.
        <img height="200" src="/assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/benefits-page.png" />
    </Step>
    <Step title = "Click on Create Benefit">
        Click on **Create Benefit**. You’ll see three configuration fields as shown in the image below: **Description**, **Type**, and **Private note**.
        <img height="200" src="/assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/create-benefit.png" />
        The **Type** field is set to Custom by default (which is what we need).
        <Note>
            The **Private note** field is specific to the Custom **Type**.  If you select a different **Type**, you’ll see configuration options specific to that type instead.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title = "Fill the configuration fields">
        <a id="configuration-fill"></a>
        Fill the **Description** and **Private note** fields where:
        - **Description** accepts regular text and is the title of the link that you want to share with the customer.
        - **Private note** uses the [Markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) so you can format text, add links, or lists.

        Make sure to add your link inside the **Private note** section so that it's only accessible post a payment.
        Then, click the **Create** button to save the configuration.

    <Info>
        If you don’t want to use an existing Custom benefit, you can create a new one by clicking **Create new**.
        Enter the configuration details, following the [Step 3](#configuration-fill) of [Create a Custom Benefit](#create-a-custom-benefit) section.

        Click on **Create Product** button in the product creation form.
        <img height="200" src="/assets/guides/automate-post-purchase-link-sharing/product-created.png" />
        Your product is successfully created along with the Custom benefit that allows you to share the links automatically to customers after purchase.

## How the Custom Benefit Appears During Checkout

Your Custom Benefit is visible to customers at multiple stages of their purchase journey:

### Checkout Page

When a customer opens the checkout session, they’ll see the **Description of your Custom Benefit** listed under **Included**.

### After Purchase

Once the customer completes their purchase, the **Description**, the **Benefit Type** (in this case, **Custom**), and the **rendered Markdown content** from the **Private note** of the **Custom Benefit** are displayed, allowing them to access any links or formatted text you’ve added.
