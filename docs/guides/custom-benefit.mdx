## Create a Custom Benefit
<Steps>
<Step title = "Go to Benefits">

        You can also go directly to:  
        `https://polar.sh/dashboard/${org_slug}/benefits`

</Step>
<Step title = "Click on Create Benefit">
    Click on **Create Benefit**. You’ll see three configuration fields as shown in the image below: **Description**, **Type**, and **Private note**.  
    <img height="200" src="/assets/guides/custom-benefit/create-benefit.png" />
    The **Type** field is set to Custom by default, which is what we need for sharing links, so you don’t need to change it.
    <Info>
    The **Private note** field is specific to the Custom **Type**.  If you select a different **Type**, you’ll see configuration options specific to that type instead. 
    </Info>
</Step>
<Step title = "Fill the configuration fields">
    <a id="configuration-fill"></a>
    Fill the **Description** and **Private note** fields. 
    - **Description** accepts regular text.
    - **Private note** requires Markdown format so you can format text, add links, or lists.  
    
    Add your link inside the **Private note** section, formatted in Markdown, as shown in the image below.
