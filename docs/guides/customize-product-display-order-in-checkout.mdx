## Reordering Products Using Checkout Link API
<Steps>
    <Step title = "Create a Checkout Link using the API">
        Open your terminal and paste the following curl command to make an API call for creating a checkout link.
        Be sure to replace:
        - \<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\> with your actual access token.   
          Make sure your token has the **`checkout_links:write`** scope enabled to use Create Checkout Link API.
        - \<PRODUCT_ID_1\>, \<PRODUCT_ID_2\>, etc., with the product IDs you want to include in the session.  
          Make sure to list them in the exact order you want them to appear during checkout.

        ```bash
        curl --request POST \
            --url https://api.polar.sh/v1/checkout-links/ \
            --header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
            --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            --data '{
            "products": [
                "<Product_ID_1>",
                "<Product_ID_2>"
            ]
        }'
        ```
    Find all the available parameters along with the description in the  [Create Checkout Link API](https://polar.sh/docs/api-reference/checkout-links/create).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Open the Checkout Link URL">
        The curl command returns a JSON. Access the checkout link URL from the <code>"url"</code> key of the JSON and open it.

        ```json
        {
            "...": "...",
            "...": "...",
            "url": "https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_..." // [!code ++]
        }
        ```
        It looks like below:

    </Step>  
    <Step title = "Change the order of products">
        If you want to change the order and make Product 2 appear before Product 1, place Product 2's ID first, followed by Product 1's ID in the API call.  
        ```bash
        curl --request POST \
            --url https://api.polar.sh/v1/checkouts/ \
            --header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
            --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            --data '{
            "products": [
                "<Product_ID_2>",
                "<Product_ID_1>"
            ]
        }'
        ```
        The checkout looks like below:
