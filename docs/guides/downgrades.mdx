    <Step title = "Choose the plan and the proration behavior">
        Select the **New product** (plan to downgrade to) and the **Proration behavior** from the dropdown menu.  
        There are two types of proration:  
        - **Next invoice**: The change will be reflected in the customerâ€™s upcoming invoice.  
        - **Invoice immediately**: The customer is charged (or credited) right away for the difference.  
        <Info>
        Regardless of the option, the subscription is downgraded immediately, only the invoicing happens according to the selected **Proration behaior**.
        </Info>
        Click on **Update Subscription**.
