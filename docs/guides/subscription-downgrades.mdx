    <Step title = "Choose the plan and the proration behavior">
        Select the **New product** (plan to downgrade to) and the **Proration behavior** from the dropdown menu.
        
        <Info>
            Regardless of the option, the subscription is downgraded immediately, only the invoicing happens according to the selected **Proration behaior**.
        </Info>
        
        There are two types of proration:  
        - **Next invoice**: The customer is charged (or credited) in the upcoming invoice for the difference.
        - **Invoice immediately**: The customer is charged (or credited) right away for the difference.
        
        Then, click on **Update Subscription**.
