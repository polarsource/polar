Customer State is a concept allowing you to query for the current state of a customer, including their active subscriptions and granted [benefits](/features/benefits/introduction), in a single [API call](/api-reference/customers/state-external) or single [webhook event](/api-reference/webhooks/customer.state_changed).

Combined with the [External ID](/features/customer-management#external-id) feature, you can get up-and-running in minutes.

## The customer state object

The customer state object contains:

- All the data about the customer.
- The list of their **active** subscriptions.
- The list of their **granted** benefits.

Thus, with that single object, you have all the required information to check if you should provision access to your service or not.

## The `customer.state_changed` webhook

To be notified of the customer state changes, you can listen to the `customer.state_changed` webhook event. It's triggered when:

- Customer is created, updated or deleted.
- A subscription is created or updated.
- A benefit is granted or revoked.

By subscribing to this webhook event, you keep your system up-to-date and update your customer's access accordingly.
