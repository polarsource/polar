Supercharge your AI agents with Polar as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

## What is MCP?

MCP is a protocol for integrating tools with AI agents. It can greatly enhance the capabilities of your AI agents by providing them with real-time data and context.

Polar offers a remote MCP server that you can connect to from most AI clients.

## How does it work?

You need a MCP-capable agent environment to use Polar over MCP. A few of them are Claude Desktop and Cursor.

## Connecting to Polar MCP

When you can specify a MCP URL, use `https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-mcp`.

If you have to specify a command, use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Polar": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

In `.cursor/mcp.json`, add:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Polar": {
      "url": "https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Windsurf

In `mcp_config.json`, add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Polar": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Codex

Add the following to your `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```sh
[mcp_servers.polar]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-mcp"]
```

### Claude Code

Run the following command:

```
claude mcp add --transport http "Polar" "https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-mcp"
```

### ChatGPT

MCP is only available for paid users in beta on ChatGPT web, by enabling Developer Mode.

Once Developer Mode is enabled, go to _Settings_ → _Connectors_ and add the MCP server using `https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-mcp`.

### Claude Desktop

Go to _Settings_ → _Connectors_ and click _Add custom connector_.

Name it "Polar" and add `https://mcp.polar.sh/mcp/polar-mcp` as the server URL.

Save, and click _Connect_ to connect to your Polar organization.
