Supercharge your AI Agents with Polar as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

## What is MCP?

MCP is a protocol for integrating tools with AI Agents. It can greatly enhance the capabilities of your AI Agents by providing them with real-time data and context.

Polar has MCP support built into the Polar TypeScript SDK.

## How does it work?

You need a MCP-capable Agent environment to use Polar as an MCP server. A few of them are Claude and Cursor.

## Using Polar as an MCP server

### Claude

Add the following server definition to your claude_desktop_config.json file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Polar": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "--package",
        "@polar-sh/sdk",
        "--",
        "mcp",
        "start",
        "--access-token",
        "..."
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Go to Cursor Settings > Features > MCP Servers > Add new MCP server and use the following settings:

- Name: Polar
- Type: command
- Command:

```bash
npx -y --package @polar-sh/sdk -- mcp start --access-token ...
```

### Help

For a full list of server arguments, run:

```bash
npx -y --package @polar-sh/sdk -- mcp start --help
```
