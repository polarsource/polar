Before being able to make authentication requests, you'll need an **OAuth2 Client**. It's the entity that'll identify you, as a third-party developer, between Polar and the final user.

You can manage them from your [User Settings](https://polar.sh/settings#oauth)

Here are the required fields:

* *Application Name*: the name of the application that'll be shown to the final users.
* *Client Type*: the type of client you are creating. [Read more](#public-clients)
* *Redirect URIs*: for security reasons, you need to declare your application URL where the users will be redirected after granting access to their data. **HTTPS URL are required unless the hostname is** `localhost`.
* *Scopes*: the list of scopes your app will be able to ask for. To improve privacy and security, select only the scopes you really need for your application.
* *Homepage URL*: the URL of your application. It'll be shown to the final users on the authorization page.

Optionally, you can also add a **logo**, **terms of service** and **privacy policy** URL. They'll all be shown to the final users on the authorization page.

Once your client is created, you'll get a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**. You'll need those values to make authentication requests.

Those values are super sensitive and should be kept secret. They allow making authentication requests on Polar!
