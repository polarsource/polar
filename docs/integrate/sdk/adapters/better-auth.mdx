### Configuring BetterAuth Server

The Polar plugin comes with a handful additional plugins which adds functionality to your stack.

- Checkout - Enables a seamless checkout integration
- Portal - Makes it possible for your customers to manage their orders, subscriptions & granted benefits
- Usage - Simple extension for listing customer meters & ingesting events for Usage Based Billing
- Webhooks - Listen for relevant Polar webhooks

```typescript
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { polar, checkout, portal, usage, webhooks } from "@polar-sh/better-auth";
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

const polarClient = new Polar({
    accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
    // Use 'sandbox' if you're using the Polar Sandbox environment
    // Remember that access tokens, products, etc. are completely separated between environments.
    // Access tokens obtained in Production are for instance not usable in the Sandbox environment.
    server: 'sandbox'
});

const auth = betterAuth({
    // ... Better Auth config
    plugins: [
        polar({
            client: polarClient,
            createCustomerOnSignUp: true,
            use: [
                checkout({
                    products: [
                        {
                            productId: "123-456-789", // ID of Product from Polar Dashboard
                            slug: "pro" // Custom slug for easy reference in Checkout URL, e.g. /checkout/pro
                        }
                    ],
                    successUrl: "/success?checkout_id={CHECKOUT_ID}",
                    authenticatedUsersOnly: true
                }),
                portal(),
                usage(),
                webhooks({
                    secret: process.env.POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
                    onCustomerStateChanged: (payload) => // Triggered when anything regarding a customer changes
                    onOrderPaid: (payload) => // Triggered when an order was paid (purchase, subscription renewal, etc.)
                    ...  // Over 25 granular webhook handlers
                    onPayload: (payload) => // Catch-all for all events
                })
            ],
        })
    ]
});
```

### Configuring BetterAuth Client

You will be using the BetterAuth Client to interact with the Polar functionalities.

```typescript
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";
import { polarClient } from "@polar-sh/better-auth";
import { organizationClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";

// This is all that is needed
// All Polar plugins, etc. should be attached to the server-side BetterAuth config
export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [polarClient()],
});
```

## Configuration Options

```typescript
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import {
  polar,
  checkout,
  portal,
  usage,
  webhooks,
} from "@polar-sh/better-auth";
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

const polarClient = new Polar({
  accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
  // Use 'sandbox' if you're using the Polar Sandbox environment
  // Remember that access tokens, products, etc. are completely separated between environments.
  // Access tokens obtained in Production are for instance not usable in the Sandbox environment.
  server: "sandbox",
});

const auth = betterAuth({
  // ... Better Auth config
  plugins: [
    polar({
      client: polarClient,
      createCustomerOnSignUp: true,
      getCustomerCreateParams: ({ user }, request) => ({
        metadata: {
          myCustomProperty: 123,
        },
      }),
      use: [
        // This is where you add Polar plugins
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Required Options

- `client`: Polar SDK client instance

### Optional Options

- `createCustomerOnSignUp`: Automatically create a Polar customer when a user signs up
- `getCustomerCreateParams`: Custom function to provide additional customer creation metadata

### Customers

When `createCustomerOnSignUp` is enabled, a new Polar Customer is automatically created when a new User is added in the Better-Auth Database.

All new customers are created with an associated `externalId`, which is the ID of your User in the Database. This allows us to skip any Polar to User mapping in your Database.

## Checkout Plugin

[Source code](https://github.com/polarsource/polar-adapters/blob/main/packages/polar-betterauth/src/plugins/checkout.ts)

To support [checkouts](/features/checkout/links) in your app, you would pass the `checkout` plugin in the `use` property. 

The checkout plugin accepts the following configuration options:

- **`products`** (optional): An array of product mappings or a function that returns them asynchronously. Each mapping contains a `productId` and a `slug` that allows you to reference products by a friendly slug instead of their full ID.

- **`successUrl`** (optional): The relative URL where customers will be redirected after a successful checkout completion. You can use the `{CHECKOUT_ID}` placeholder in the URL to include the checkout session ID in the redirect.

- **`authenticatedUsersOnly`** (optional): A boolean flag that controls whether checkout sessions require user authentication. When set to `true`, only authenticated users can initiate checkouts and the customer information will be automatically associated with the authenticated user. When `false`, anonymous checkouts are allowed.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use Checkout Plugin">
    Update the `use` property of the Polar plugin for BetterAuth client to have the `checkout` plugin.

    ```typescript icon="square-js" Checkout Plugin Example
    import { 
      polar,
      checkout // [!code ++]
    } from "@polar-sh/better-auth";

    const auth = betterAuth({
        // ... Better Auth config
        plugins: [
            polar({
                ...
                use: [
                    checkout({ // [!code ++]
                        // Optional field - will make it possible to pass a slug to checkout instead of Product ID
                        products: [ { productId: "123-456-789", slug: "pro" } ], // [!code ++]
                        // Relative URL to return to when checkout is successfully completed
                        successUrl: "/success?checkout_id={CHECKOUT_ID}", // [!code ++]
                        // Wheather you want to allow unauthenticated checkout sessions or not
                        authenticatedUsersOnly: true // [!code ++]
                    }) // [!code ++]
                ],
            })
        ]
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create checkouts using BetterAuth client">
    When the `checkout` plugin is passed, you are then able to initialize Checkout Sessions using the `checkout` method on the BetterAuth client. This will redirect the user to the product's checkout link.

    ```typescript icon="square-js" BetterAuth Checkout with Polar Example
    await authClient.checkout({
      // Polar Product IDs
      products: ["e651f46d-ac20-4f26-b769-ad088b123df2"], // [!code ++]
      // OR
      // if "products" in passed in the checkout plugin's config, you may pass the slug
      // slug: "pro", // [!code ++]
    });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Organization Support

This plugin supports the Organization plugin. If you pass the organization ID to the Checkout referenceId, you will be able to keep track of purchases made from organization members.

```typescript
const organizationId = (await authClient.organization.list())?.data?.[0]?.id,

await authClient.checkout({
    // Any Polar Product ID can be passed here
    products: ["e651f46d-ac20-4f26-b769-ad088b123df2"],
    // Or, if you setup "products" in the Checkout Config, you can pass the slug
    slug: 'pro',
    // Reference ID will be saved as `referenceId` in the metadata of the checkout, order & subscription object
    referenceId: organizationId
});
```

## Portal Plugin

A plugin which enables customer management of their purchases, orders and subscriptions.

```typescript
import { polar, checkout, portal } from "@polar-sh/better-auth";

const auth = betterAuth({
    // ... Better Auth config
    plugins: [
        polar({
            ...
            use: [
                checkout(...),
                portal()
            ],
        })
    ]
});
```

The portal-plugin gives the BetterAuth Client a set of customer management methods, scoped under `authClient.customer`.

### Customer Portal Management

The following method will redirect the user to the Polar Customer Portal, where they can see orders, purchases, subscriptions, benefits, etc.

```typescript
await authClient.customer.portal();
```

### Customer State

The portal plugin also adds a convenient state-method for retrieving the general Customer State.

```typescript
const { data: customerState } = await authClient.customer.state();
```

The customer state object contains:

- All the data about the customer.
- The list of their active subscriptions
  - Note: This does not include subscriptions done by a parent organization. See the subscription list-method below for more information.
- The list of their granted benefits.
- The list of their active meters, with their current balance.

Thus, with that single object, you have all the required information to check if you should provision access to your service or not.

[You can learn more about the Polar Customer State in the Polar Docs](https://docs.polar.sh/integrate/customer-state).

### Benefits, Orders & Subscriptions

The portal plugin adds 3 convenient methods for listing benefits, orders & subscriptions relevant to the authenticated user/customer.

[All of these methods use the Polar CustomerPortal APIs](https://docs.polar.sh/api-reference/customer-portal)

#### Benefits

This method only lists granted benefits for the authenticated user/customer.

```typescript
const { data: benefits } = await authClient.customer.benefits.list({
  query: {
    page: 1,
    limit: 10,
  },
});
```

#### Orders

This method lists orders like purchases and subscription renewals for the authenticated user/customer.

```typescript
const { data: orders } = await authClient.customer.orders.list({
  query: {
    page: 1,
    limit: 10,
    productBillingType: "one_time", // or 'recurring'
  },
});
```

#### Subscriptions

This method lists the subscriptions associated with authenticated user/customer.

```typescript
const { data: subscriptions } = await authClient.customer.subscriptions.list({
  query: {
    page: 1,
    limit: 10,
    active: true,
  },
});
```

**Important** - Organization Support

This will **not** return subscriptions made by a parent organization to the authenticated user.

However, you can pass a `referenceId` to this method. This will return all subscriptions associated with that referenceId instead of subscriptions associated with the user.

So in order to figure out if a user should have access, pass the user's organization ID to see if there is an active subscription for that organization.

```typescript
const organizationId = (await authClient.organization.list())?.data?.[0]?.id,

const { data: subscriptions } = await authClient.customer.orders.list({
    query: {
	    page: 1,
		limit: 10,
		active: true,
        referenceId: organizationId
    },
});

const userShouldHaveAccess = subscriptions.some(
    sub => // Your logic to check subscription product or whatever.
)
```

## Usage Plugin

[Source code](https://github.com/polarsource/polar-adapters/blob/main/packages/polar-betterauth/src/plugins/usage.ts)

A plugin for Usage Based Billing that allows you to [ingest events](#event-ingestion) from your application and list the [authenticated user's Usage Meter](#customer-meters).

To enable [usage based billing](/integrate/sdk/adapters/better-auth) in your app, you would pass the `usage` plugin in the `use` property.

```typescript icon="square-js" Usage Plugin Example
import {
  polar, checkout, portal,
  usage // [!code ++]
} from "@polar-sh/better-auth";

const auth = betterAuth({
    // ... Better Auth config
    plugins: [
        polar({
            ...
            use: [
                checkout(...),
                portal(),
                usage() // [!code ++]
            ],
        })
    ]
});
```

### Event Ingestion

Polar's Usage Based Billing builds entirely on event ingestion. Ingest events from your application, create Meters to represent that usage, and add metered prices to Products to charge for it.

The `ingestion` method of the `usage` plugin accepts the following parameters:

- `event` (string): The name of the event to ingest. For example, `ai_usage`, `video_streamed` or `file_uploaded`.

- `metadata` (object): A record containing key-value pairs that provide additional context about the event. Values can be strings, numbers, or booleans. This is useful for storing information that can be used to filter the events or compute the actual usage. For example, you can store the duration of the video streamed or the size of the file uploaded.

<Info>
  The authenticated user is automatically associated with the ingested event.
</Info>

```typescript icon="square-js" Event Ingestion with Usage Plugin Example
const { data: ingested } = await authClient.usage.ingestion({
  event: "file-uploads",
  metadata: {
    uploadedFiles: 12,
  },
});
```

### Customer Meters

A method to list the authenticated user's Usage Meters (aka Customer Meters). A Customer Meter contains all the information about their consumption on your defined meters.

The `meters` method of the `usage` plugin accepts the following parameters:

- `page` (number): The page number for pagination (starts from 1).

- `limit` (number): The maximum number of meters to return per page.

```typescript icon="square-js" Customer Meters with Usage Plugin Example
const { data: customerMeters } = await authClient.usage.meters.list({
  query: {
    page: 1,
    limit: 10,
  },
});
```

The `meters` method returns the following fields in the response object:

(TODO verify with Birk)

- **Customer Information**: Details about the authenticated customer
- **Meter Information**: Configuration and settings of the usage meter
- **Customer Meter Information**:
  - **Consumed Units**: Total units consumed by the customer
  - **Credited Units**: Units credited back to the customer
  - **Balance**: Current balance of consumed vs credited units

## Webhooks Plugin

[Source code](https://github.com/polarsource/polar-adapters/blob/main/packages/polar-betterauth/src/plugins/webhooks.ts)

The `webhooks` plugin can be used to capture incoming events from your Polar organization.

To set up the Polar `webhooks` plugin with the BetterAuth client, follow the steps below:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Webhook Endpoints in Polar">
    Configure a Webhook endpoint in your Polar Organization Settings page by following [this guide](/integrate/webhooks/endpoints). Webhook endpoint is configured at /polar/webhooks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Webhook Secret">
    Add the obtained webhook secret to your application environment as an environment variable (to be used as `process.env.POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`):
  
    ```bash .env
    POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET="..."
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Webhooks Plugin in BetterAuth client">
    Pass the `webhooks` plugin in the `use` property.
    
    ```typescript icon="square-js" Webhooks Plugin Example
    import {
      polar,
      webhooks // [!code ++]
    } from "@polar-sh/better-auth";

    const auth = betterAuth({
        // ... Better Auth config
        plugins: [
            polar({
                ...
                use: [
                    webhooks({ // [!code ++]
                        secret: process.env.POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET, // [!code ++]
                        onCustomerStateChanged: (payload) => // Triggered when anything regarding a customer changes // [!code ++]
                        onOrderPaid: (payload) => // Triggered when an order was paid (purchase, subscription renewal, etc.) // [!code ++]
                        ...  // Over 25 granular webhook handlers // [!code ++]
                        onPayload: (payload) => // Catch-all for all events // [!code ++]
                    }) // [!code ++]
                ],
            })
        ]
    });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

The `webhooks` plugin allows you to invoke handlers for all Polar webhook events:

- `onPayload` - Catch-all handler for any incoming Webhook event
- `onCheckoutCreated` - Triggered when a checkout is created
- `onCheckoutUpdated` - Triggered when a checkout is updated
- `onOrderCreated` - Triggered when an order is created
- `onOrderPaid` - Triggered when an order is paid
- `onOrderRefunded` - Triggered when an order is refunded
- `onRefundCreated` - Triggered when a refund is created
- `onRefundUpdated` - Triggered when a refund is updated
- `onSubscriptionCreated` - Triggered when a subscription is created
- `onSubscriptionUpdated` - Triggered when a subscription is updated
- `onSubscriptionActive` - Triggered when a subscription becomes active
- `onSubscriptionCanceled` - Triggered when a subscription is canceled
