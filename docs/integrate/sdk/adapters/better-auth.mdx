## Installation

```bash

```

### Preparation

Go to your Polar Organization Settings, and create an Organization Access Token. Add it to your environment.

```bash
# .env
POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
```

```typescript
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { polar } from "@polar-sh/better-auth";
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

const client = new Polar({
    accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
    // Use 'sandbox' if you're using the Polar Sandbox environment
    // Remember that access tokens, products, etc. are completely separated between environments.
    // Access tokens obtained in Production are for instance not usable in the Sandbox environment.
    server: 'production'
});

const auth = betterAuth({
    // ... Better Auth config
    plugins: [
        polar({
            client,
            // Enable automatic Polar Customer creation on signup
            createCustomerOnSignUp: true,
            // Enable customer portal
            enableCustomerPortal: true, // Deployed under /portal for authenticated users
            // Configure checkout
            checkout: {
                enabled: true,
                products: [
                    {
                        productId: "123-456-789", // ID of Product from Polar Dashboard
                        slug: "pro" // Custom slug for easy reference in Checkout URL, e.g. /checkout/pro
                    }
                ],
                successUrl: "/success?checkout_id={CHECKOUT_ID}"
            },
            // Incoming Webhooks handler will be installed at /polar/webhooks
            webhooks: {
                secret: process.env.POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
                onPayload: ...,
            }
        })
    ]
});
```

The plugin supports handlers for all Polar webhook events:

- `onSubscriptionCreated` - Triggered when a subscription is created
- `onSubscriptionUpdated` - Triggered when a subscription is updated
- `onSubscriptionActive` - Triggered when a subscription becomes active
- `onSubscriptionCanceled` - Triggered when a subscription is canceled
- `onSubscriptionRevoked` - Triggered when a subscription is revoked
- `onSubscriptionUncanceled` - Triggered when a subscription cancellation is reversed
- `onProductCreated` - Triggered when a product is created

- `onCustomerUpdated` - Triggered when a customer is updated
- `onCustomerDeleted` - Triggered when a customer is deleted
- `onCustomerStateChanged` - Triggered when a customer is created

## API Routes

The plugin adds the following API routes:

- `GET /checkout/:slug` - Redirect to Polar checkout
- `GET /state` - Customer state (Customer Data, Active Subscriptions, Entitlements, etc.) for the authenticated user
- `GET /portal` - Redirects to Polar Customer Portal for authenticated user
- `POST /polar/webhooks` - Incoming webhooks are automatically parsed & validated

## Customers

When `createCustomerOnSignUp` is enabled, a new Polar Customer is automatically created when a new User is added in the Better-Auth Database.

All new customers are created with an associated `externalId`, which is the ID of your User in the Database. This allows us to skip any Polar Customer to User mapping in your Database.

## Checkouts

When checkouts are enabled, you're able to initialize Checkout Sessions on the `/checkout/:slug` route.

### Checkouts with slug

If you pass an array of products to the configuration, you're able to use the slug as a reference instead of using the product id.

### Checkouts with product id

All your organization products are eligible for checkouts, even if they're not passed to the products-configuration.

You can initialize a checkout session like following - `/checkout?productId=123-456-789`
