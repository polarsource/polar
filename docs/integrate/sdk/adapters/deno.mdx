## Checkout

Create a Checkout handler which takes care of redirections.

```typescript
import { Checkout } from "jsr:@polar-sh/deno";

Deno.serve(
  Checkout({
    accessToken: "xxx",
    theme: "dark", // Enforces the theme - System-preferred theme will be set if left omitted
  })
);
```

### Query Params

Pass query params to this route.

- products `?products=123`
- customerId (optional) `?products=123&customerId=xxx`
- customerExternalId (optional) `?products=123&customerExternalId=xxx`
- customerEmail (optional) `?products=123&customerEmail=janedoe@gmail.com`
- customerName (optional) `?products=123&customerName=Jane`
- metadata (optional) `URL-Encoded JSON string`

## Customer Portal

Create a customer portal where your customer can view orders and subscriptions.

```typescript
import { CustomerPortal } from "jsr:@polar-sh/deno";

Deno.serve(
  CustomerPortal({
    accessToken: "xxx",
    getCustomerId: (req) => "",
    server: "sandbox",
  })
);
```

## Webhooks

A simple utility which resolves incoming webhook payloads by signing the webhook secret properly.

```typescript
import { Webhooks } from "jsr:@polar-sh/deno";

Deno.serve(
    Webhooks({
        webhookSecret: Deno.env.get('POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET'),
        onPayload: async (payload) => /** Handle payload */,
    })
);
```

### Payload Handlers
