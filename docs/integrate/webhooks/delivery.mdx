Once a webhook endpoint is setup you will have access to the delivery overview
page. Here you can:

- See historic deliveries
- Review payload sent
- Trigger redelivery in case of failure

Now, let's integrate our endpoint route to validate, parse & handle incoming webhooks.

## Validate & parse webhooks

You now need to setup a route handler for the endpoint registered on Polar to
receive, validate and parse webhooks before handling them according to your
needs.

### Using our SDKs

Our TypeScript & Python SDKs come with a built-in helper function to easily
validate and parse the webhook event - see full examples below.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript JS (Express)
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express'
import { validateEvent, WebhookVerificationError } from '@polar-sh/sdk/webhooks'

const app = express()

app.post(
  '/webhook',
  express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }),
  (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    try {
      const event = validateEvent(
        req.body,
        req.headers,
        process.env['POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET'] ?? '',
      )

      // Process the event

      res.status(202).send('')
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof WebhookVerificationError) {
        res.status(403).send('')
      }
      throw error
    }
  },
)
```

```python Python (Flask)
import os
from flask import Flask, request
from polar_sdk.webhooks import validate_event, WebhookVerificationError

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    try:
        event = validate_event(
            payload=request.data,
            headers=request.headers,
            secret=os.getenv('POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET', ''),
        )

        # Process the event

        return "", 202
    except WebhookVerificationError as e:
        return "", 403
```

</CodeGroup>

Both examples above expect an environment variable named `POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
to be set to the secret you configured during the endpoint setup.


### Custom validation

We follow the [Standard Webhooks](https://www.standardwebhooks.com/)
standard which offers [many libraries across languages](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/tree/main/libraries) to
easily validate signatures. Or you can follow their
[specification](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/blob/main/spec/standard-webhooks.md)
in case you want to roll your own.

<Info>
  **Note: Secret needs to be base64 encoded**

  One common gotcha with the specification is that the webhook secret is expected to be
  base64 encoded. You don't have to do this with our SDK as it takes care of the
  implementation details with better developer ergonomics.

## Failure Handling

### Delivery Retries

If we hit an error while trying to reach your endpoint, whether it is a temporary network error or a bug, we'll retry to send the event up to **10 times** with an exponential backoff.

### Delivery Timeouts

We timeout our requests to your endpoint after **20 seconds**. Triggering a
retry attempt after a delay as explained above. However, we strongly recommend you optimize your endpoint route to be fast. A
best practice is for your webhook handler to queue a background worker task to handle the
payload asynchronously.

## Troubleshooting

### Not receiving webhooks

Seeing deliveries on Polar, but not receiving them on your end? Below are some
common techniques to resolve the issue depending on the reported error status.

**General**

_Start ngrok or similar_

Make sure you have started `ngrok` or whatever tunneling service you're using
during local development.

_Add excessive logging_

E.g
`console.log('webhook.handler_called')`,
`console.log('webhook.validate_signature')`,
`console.log('webhook.signature_validated')` etc.

So you can easily confirm if the handler is called and how far it gets before
any issues arise.


`HTTP 404`

- Try `curl -vvv -X POST <copy-paste-endpoint-url>` in your terminal to confirm the
route exists and see any issues along the way
- Try adding trailing `/` to the URL on Polar. Often `/foo` is resolved to
  `/foo/` by frameworks.

`HTTP 403`

- Using middleware for authorization? Make sure to exclude the webhook route
  from it since it needs to be publicly accessible
- Using Cloudflare? Check the firewall logs to verify if they are blocking our
  requests and setup a custom WAF rule to accept incoming requests from Polar.

### Invalid signature exceptions

Rolling your own webhook validation logic? Make sure to base64 encode the secret
you configured on Polar in your code before generating the signature to validate
against.
