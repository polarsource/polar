## Billing Events

### Checkout

<CheckoutCreated />
<CheckoutUpdated />

### Subscriptions

In order to properly implement logic for handling subscriptions, you should look into the following events.

**[`subscription.created`](#subscription-created)**

Fired when a new subscription has been created.

**[`subscription.updated`](#subscription-updated)**

Use this event if you want to handle cancellations, un-cancellations, etc. The updated event is a catch-all event for `subscription.active` , `subscription.canceled` , `subscription.uncanceled` & `subscription.revoked`

**[`order.created`](#order-created)**

In case you want to do logic when a subscription is renewed, you should listen to `order.created` and the `billing_reason` field. It can be `purchase` , `subscription_create` , `subscription_cycle` & `subscription_update` . `subscription_cycle` is used when subscriptions renew.
