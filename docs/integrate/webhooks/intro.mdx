Webhooks allow you to subscribe to events when they occur on Polar.
So you don't have to poll our API and can stay up-to-date asyncronously. You
simply get a HTTP POST request to a registered endpoint once events you
subscribe to are triggered across our system.

Our implementation follow the [Standard Webhooks](https://www.standardwebhooks.com/) specification.

**Slack & Discord Support**

Our webhooks can also be sent in Slack & Discord format out-of-the-box so you
can easily setup in-app notifications for your team.
