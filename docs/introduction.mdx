## What is Polar?

Polar is an **open-source billing infrastructure platform** designed specifically for developers, designers, and digital creators who want to monetize their products without the complexity of traditional payment systems.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Beyond Payment Processing" icon="credit-card">
    Unlike Stripe that only handles transactions, we provide complete billing
    infrastructure with tax compliance, product management, and automated access
    & delivery.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Merchant of Record" icon="globe">
    We handle all international tax compliance, so you can sell globally without
    worrying about VAT, GST, or sales tax regulations.

## Problems We Solve

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tax Compliance Nightmare" icon="building-columns">
    **The Problem**: Selling digital products globally means dealing with VAT, GST, and sales tax in dozens of jurisdictions, each with different rates, rules, and filing requirements. Most developers either ignore this (risky) or avoid international sales entirely.

    **Polar's Solution**: As your Merchant of Record, we handle all international tax compliance. We calculate, collect, and remit taxes worldwide. You focus on building; we handle the paperwork.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Complex Billing Infrastructure" icon="gears">
    **The Problem**: Building subscription billing, product catalogs, customer portals, and payment flows from scratch takes months of development time and ongoing maintenance.

    **Polar's Solution**: Complete billing infrastructure out-of-the-box with APIs that let you integrate in minutes. No need to build customer portals, handle subscription lifecycle, or manage failed payments.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manual Access & Delivery Overhead" icon="box">
    **The Problem**: Manually sending license keys, granting repository access, or managing Discord invites for every purchase doesn't scale and creates delays for customers.

    **Polar's Solution**: Automated benefit delivery for common developer needs - license keys, file downloads, GitHub repo access, Discord roles, and more. Customers get instant access.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High Processing Costs" icon="money-bill">
    **The Problem**: Traditional MoR solutions charge 5-8% per transaction plus monthly fees, eating into your profits before you even start.

    **Polar's Solution**: 20% lower fees at just 4% + 40¢ per transaction with no monthly minimums. We earn when you earn.
