## Using the Polar SDK

Polar comes in the form of an SDK, and is designed to be used in your existing backend infrastructure. We currently have SDKs for:

- [JavaScript/TypeScript](/integrate/sdk/typescript)
- [Python](/integrate/sdk/python)
- [Go](/integrate/sdk/golang)
- [PHP](/integrate/sdk/php)

Navigate to the relevant SDK page to learn more about the SDK and how to use it. In this particular guide, we'll focus on using the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK.

## Using a Polar Adapter

Polar's Adapters are small framework-specific utilities which makes it super-easy to integrate Polar.

They can be used to:

- Create Checkout Sessions
- Create a Customer Portal
- Listen for Polar Webhooks (e.g. for events like a customer being created, a subscription being updated, etc.)

We currently have adapters for the most popular frameworks:

- [Next.js](/integrate/sdk/adapters/nextjs)
- [BetterAuth](/integrate/sdk/adapters/better-auth)
- [Express](/integrate/sdk/adapters/express)
- [Fastify](/integrate/sdk/adapters/fastify)
- [Hono](/integrate/sdk/adapters/hono)
- [Deno](/integrate/sdk/adapters/deno)
- [Nuxt](/integrate/sdk/adapters/nuxt)
- [Remix](/integrate/sdk/adapters/remix)
- [SvelteKit](/integrate/sdk/adapters/sveltekit)
- [Tanstack Start](/integrate/sdk/adapters/tanstack-start)
- [Elysia](/integrate/sdk/adapters/elysia)
- [Astro](/integrate/sdk/adapters/astro)
- [Laravel](/integrate/sdk/adapters/laravel)
