## FAQ

**Why are AI services, products and websites restricted?**

We love LLMs and the future opportunities they represent for developers &
entrepreneurs. However, some use them poorly and with less valid intents.
Generating a quick & basic service or product and a website with fake testimonials only
in hopes to make a quick buck. Resulting in low quality, trust and high risk of
customer support, refunds and chargebacks.

So using AI to build a better product? Zero problem.
Using AI to quickly put something together to sell? No thank you.

**Why do directories & boards require closer review?**

They often sell premium placement, i.e ads, without meeting compliance
requirements for advertising. Or even where it's their sole purpose to sell
placement.

**Why do marketing services require closer review?**

Too many services offer sketchy marketing tactics and mass outreach
(unsolicited) features. There is no short-cut to sales beyond offering a great
product & service. We love marketing services that reflect that and focus on the
long game vs. shortcuts and hacks.

**Can I sell pre-orders or use paid waitlists for my service to validate demand
before build?**

Generally, no. It's a high risk category for us as the Merchant of Record.
Sellers could withdraw funds and never deliver the service or not as promised.
Causing consumers to demand refunds or dispute the sale against us at a later
date.

For high-trust cases from developers with a track record, we're able to make
exceptions, but simultaneously need to adapt our payout process to withhold all
funds until verified fulfilment.

**Why are marketplaces or human services (consultancy) not allowed?**

We hope to change this status quo amongst Merchant of Records long-term, but
both come with additional compliance and risk challenges. Since fulfilment is
not digital, immediate or between known parties to us, we cannot fulfil our
compliance & risk requirements or effectively mitigate potential disputes.


**Why are Only Fans services not allowed?**

Close & blurred lines between the service and the content & service provided on
OnlyFans, i.e often adult content. In addition to us having seen
fraudulent & deceptive behavior in the category. We're simply not comfortable
acting as the Merchant of Record here.
