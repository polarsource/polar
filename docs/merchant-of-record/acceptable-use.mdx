As your Merchant of Record (MoR), we are the reseller of all digital goods and
services and focus exclusively on digital products. Therefore we cannot support
physical goods or entirely human services, e.g consultation or support. In
addition to not accepting the sale of anything illegal, harmful, abusive,
deceptive or sketchy.

### Acceptable Products & Businesses

* Software & SaaS
* Digital products: Templates, eBooks, PDFs, code, icons, fonts, design assets, photos, videos, audio etc
* Premium content & access: Discord server, GitHub repositories, courses and content requiring a subscription.

**General rule of acceptable services**

Digital goods, software or services that can be fulfilled by…

1. Polar on your behalf (License Keys, File Downloads, GitHub- or Discord invites or private links, e.g premium YouTube videos etc)
2. Your site/service using our APIs to grant immediate access to digital assets
or services for customers with a one-time purchase or subscriptions

Combined with being something you’d proudly boast about in public, i.e nothing illegal, unfair, deceptive, abusive, harmful or shady.

Don’t hesitate to [reach out to us](/support) in advance in case you’re unsure if your use case would be approved.


### Prohibited & Restricted Businesses

We reserve the right to add to it at any time. Combined with placing your account under further review or suspend it without notice in case we consider the usage deceptive, fraudulent or high-risk.

* Deceptive products, e.g fake testimonials, branding designed to associate the product with another service/brand to deceive consumers

* Products you don’t own the IP of or have required licenses to resell
* Advertising services
* Trademark violations
* Human services, e.g marketing, design, web development and consulting in general.
* Marketplaces. Selling others’ products or services using Polar against an upfront payment or with an agreed upon revenue share.
* [Prohibited or restricted by Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-se/legal/restricted-businesses) – our underlying payment processor.

**Why are marketplaces or human services (consultancy) not allowed?**

We hope to change this status quo amongst Merchant of Records long-term, but both come with additional compliance and risk challenges. Since fulfilment is not digital, immediate or between known parties to us. We therefore cannot fulfil our compliance requirements nor counter potential chargebacks down the road.
