As a Merchant of Record (MoR), we act as the reseller of digital goods and services. Therefore, we need to make sure that businesses using Polar complies with our [acceptable products & use](/merchant-of-record/acceptable-use) policies. Combined with continuously monitoring, reviewing and preventing fraud, unacceptable use, bad actors and high risk accounts.

### First payout review (24-48h)

You will need to go through our main review ahead of the initial payout. We’ll reach out over email within 24h (often faster) with:

1. A quick survey about your business, products and intended use case with Polar
2. Identity verification (KYC) using passport (or drivers license) and selfie. It’s secure, easy and quick to submit using Stripe Identity.

We need to perform this review to ensure compliance with our [acceptable products & use](/merchant-of-record/acceptable-use) policy. Combined with meeting our own KYC/AML requirements as a billing platform.


**Submit upfront (Soon)**

We’ll soon offer the ability to submit all of this information in advance to speed up the initial payout even further and without concern of any issues or delays.


### Continuous reviews (Async)

We continuously monitor all transactions across our platform to proactively prevent fraud. In addition to performing asynchronous reviews of accounts at certain sale thresholds. These reviews are often completed within hours and without any additional information required from you.

You’ll get notified over email that a review is taking place. Payouts will be paused during this time, but it has no impact on your customers’ experience or ability to purchase, subscribe or checkout at any time.

We look at:

* Risk scores across historic transactions
* Refund- & Chargeback ratio
* Appropriate next sales threshold for a review given the above


**High chargeback ratios**

Credit card networks, e.g Visa/Mastercard, consider 0.7% of sales in chargebacks excessive. Exceeding it can lead to monitoring programs with high costs, penalties and ultimately termination.

We therefore reach out proactively to collaborate on maintaining a low chargeback ratio and reducing it ahead of getting close to these thresholds.
