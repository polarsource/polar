### Payments & Merchant of Record

We support payments globally except from countries with US sanctions.

As your Merchant of Record (MoR) we take on the liability for international sales taxes - [read more here](/merchant-of-record/introduction).

### Payouts

Polar uses Stripe Connect Express to issue payouts to residents or businesses in any of the countries below.

<Note>
**FAQ: Stripe is not supported in my country**

Stripe Connect Express for payouts is a separate product from Stripe Payments.

In some cases, Stripe Payments might not be available for merchants in your country, but Stripe Connect Express is for payouts using cross-border transfers.

Since Polar is the Merchant of Record and uses Stripe Connect Express for payouts, we're able to support sellers in all of the countries below.
