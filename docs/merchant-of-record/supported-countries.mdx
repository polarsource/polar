### Payments & Merchant of Record

We support payments globally except from countries with US sanctions.

As your Merchant of Record (MoR) we take on the liability for international sales taxes - [read more here](/merchant-of-record/introduction).

### Payouts

Polar uses Stripe Connect Express to issue payouts to residents or businesses in any of the countries below.

<Note>
**FAQ: Stripe is not supported in my country**

Stripe Connect Express for payouts is a separate product from Stripe Payments.

In some cases, Stripe Payments might not be available for merchants in your country, but Stripe Connect Express is for payouts using cross-border transfers.

Since Polar is the Merchant of Record and uses Stripe Connect Express for payouts, we're able to support sellers in all of the countries below.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use Polar in countries (e.g. India) where Stripe is invite-only?">
    <Note>Stripe Connect Express is a different product than the regular Stripe payments.</Note>
    Yes, any individual or company operating in our [supported countries](/merchant-of-record/supported-countries) can receive payouts from Polar even if Stripe standalone is invite-only there.
    
    This is possible as Polar is the Merchant of Record, all payments from customers are made to Polar (US). [Stripe Connect Express](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts) is then used to issue payouts, and is supported in more countries via cross-border transfer than Stripe Payments standalone.
    
    You might still see a warning in Stripe Connect Express that payments are invite-only, but don't worry. No direct sales are made directly to the Stripe Connect Express account. They're all made to Polar (US) as a platform and the merchant of record. We only use the transfer and payout feature of Stripe Connect Express which is available in all of our [supported countries](/merchant-of-record/supported-countries).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use Polar as an individual to make sales globally?">
    Yes, given that Stripe Connect Express supports individual as a business type in your region.

    To know which business type is supported in your country, follow steps as below:
    - Open required [verification information](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information#US+RS+express+recipient+individual+transfers) by Stripe to set up a business or personal account in your country.
    - Ensure `Platform Country` is set to `United States (US)`.
    - Ensure `Dashboard Type` is set to `express`.
    - Ensure `Service Agreement` is set to `recipient`.
    - Ensure `Capability` is set to `transfers`.
    - Select the correct `Account Country` relevant to you.
    - Click on the toggle for `Business Type` which will allow you know if individual, business, company or LLC/LLP is supported by Stripe Connect Express in that region.
