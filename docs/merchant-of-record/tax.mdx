### Polar's VAT Number

As a Merchant of Record, Polar is registered for EU VAT under the One Stop Shop (OSS) program.

**VAT Number:** `EU372061545`

### EU One Stop Shop (OSS)

The EU One Stop Shop (OSS) is a simplified VAT registration and reporting scheme that allows businesses outside the EU to register for VAT in a single EU member state and remit VAT for sales across all EU countries through that registration.

Polar, as a Delaware C Corporation (US entity), uses the OSS program through Ireland. This is a legitimate and widely used approach for non-EU businesses selling digital goods and services to EU customers.

### Why EU372061545 is Valid

VAT numbers issued under the OSS scheme use the `EU` prefix followed by 9 digits. This format differs from traditional country-specific VAT numbers (like `IE1234567X` for Ireland or `DE123456789` for Germany).

The `EU` prefix indicates an OSS registration, which is:

- **Issued by EU tax authorities** - Specifically through the member state where the business registered (Ireland in Polar's case)
- **Recognized across all EU member states** - Valid for B2B transactions throughout the European Union
- **Listed in the VIES database** - The EU's VAT Information Exchange System validates OSS numbers

### Accounting Software Compatibility

Some accounting software may not recognize `EU` prefixed VAT numbers because they predate the OSS program or lack full VIES integration.

If your accounting software doesn't recognize `EU372061545`:

1. **Manual entry** - Enter the VAT number manually if the software allows overriding validation
2. **Contact support** - Ask your software vendor to update their VAT validation to include OSS numbers
3. **VIES verification** - Use the [official VIES VAT validation](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/) to confirm the number is valid
