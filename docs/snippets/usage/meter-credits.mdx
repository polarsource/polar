You can give credits to your customers on a specific meter. This is done by creating a Meter Credits Benefit, which is a special type of benefit that allows you to give credits to your customers on a specific meter.

On a recurring product, the customer will be credited the amount of units specified in the benefit at the beginning of every subscription cycle period â€” monthly or yearly.
