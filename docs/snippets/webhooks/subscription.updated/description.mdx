Sent when a subscription is updated. This event fires for all changes to the subscription, including renewals.

If you want more specific events, you can listen to `subscription.active`, `subscription.canceled`, and `subscription.revoked`.

To listen specifically for renewals, you can listen to `order.created` events and check the `billing_reason` field.

**Discord & Slack support:** On cancellation and revocation. Renewals are skipped.
