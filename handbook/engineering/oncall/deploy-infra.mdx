## Context

The `render.yaml` blueprint is **not synced automatically**. Any changes to workers, environment variables, or new services require manual synchronization through the Render dashboard.

## When to Use

- After making changes to `render.yaml`

## Procedure

### Step 1: Sync Blueprint in Render Dashboard

Navigate to the Render Blueprint dashboard and manually sync:

```
https://dashboard.render.com/blueprint/exs-cgvt2qiut4mc4kajuf6g
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Blueprint URL">
    Go to the URL above and log in to Render if needed
  </Step>

<Step title="Click Manual Sync">
  Click the "Sync" button to manually sync the blueprint.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Changes">
  Review the proposed changes carefully. Render will show you a diff of what
  will be updated.
</Step>

<Step title="Apply Changes">
  Click the sync/apply button to deploy the infrastructure changes
</Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Deployment">
    Watch the deployment logs to ensure all services start successfully
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Update Deploy Workflow (For New Services)

If you created a new service, you **must** add its `serviceId` to the deployment workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the Service ID">
    After creating the service in Render, copy its service ID from the service settings or URL
  </Step>

<Step title="Edit Deploy Workflow">
  Open `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and add the new service ID to the
  appropriate section
</Step>

  <Step title="Commit Changes">
    Commit and push the changes to the deploy workflow
  </Step>
</Steps>

Example structure in `deploy.yml`:

```yaml
deploy-sandbox:
  name: "Deploy to Sandbox 🧪"
  uses: ./.github/workflows/deploy-environment.yml
  with:
    environment: sandbox
    docker-digest: ${{ needs.build.outputs.digest }}
    # Modify render-service-ids
    render-service-ids: "srv-crkocgbtq21c73ddsdbg,srv-d089jj7diees73934kgg"
    # more config ...
```

## Post-Procedure

- [ ] Verify all services are running
- [ ] Test critical functionality
- [ ] Document the changes in the on-call log
- [ ] Notify the team of infrastructure changes
- [ ] Monitor error rates and performance metrics
