---

Our recruitment process is designed to identify engineers who align with our values. We believe in practical assessment over theoretical interviews.

## Our Philosophy

- **Values-first hiring**: Technical skills matter, but cultural fit and behavioral alignment are equally important
- **Practical assessment**: Real code contributions tell us more than whiteboard exercises
- **AI-friendly**: We encourage and expect candidates to use AI tools effectively

## The 5-Step Process

### 1. Introduction Call (30 minutes or 1 hour)
**Who**: Birk

**Purpose**:
- Get to know the candidate
- Explain our process and company culture
- Answer initial questions
- Assess basic communication and interest

### 2. Technical Assessment
**Format**: Pull request to our main repository

**Duration**: Candidate's choice (typically 3-6 hours)

**Purpose**:
- See how candidates approach real problems in our codebase
- Evaluate code quality, problem-solving, and attention to detail
- Understand their comfort level with our tech stack
- Encourage AI tool usage

**What we look for**:
- Clean, readable code
- Thoughtful approach to the problem
- Effective use of available tools (including AI)

### 3. Technical Discussion (1 hour)
**Who**: Engineering team member

**Purpose**:
- Deep dive into the pull request
- Discuss technical decisions and trade-offs
- Explore how they would improve or extend their solution
- Assess problem-solving approach and communication

### 4. Behavioral & Culture Interview (1 hour)
**Who**: Engineering team member

**Purpose**: Assess alignment with our values and working style

**Key areas to explore**:
- **Ownership**: "Tell me about a time you took ownership of a problem that wasn't clearly yours"
- **Delivery**: "Describe a situation where you had to balance speed and quality"
- **Collaboration**: "How do you handle disagreements about technical decisions?"
- **Initiative**: "Describe a time you improved something without being asked"

### 5. Reference Check
**Format**: Brief conversations with previous colleagues/managers

**Purpose**: Validate our assessment and understand working style

## Decision Making

- **Strong no at any stage**: Process stops immediately
- **Final decision**: Consensus among interviewers
- **Timeline**: Aim to complete entire process within 1 week of initial contact

## For Candidates

### What to Expect
- Respectful, efficient process
- Real feedback on your pull request
- Opportunities to ask questions at every stage
- Clear communication about next steps

### How to Succeed
- Take time to understand the codebase before jumping in
- Write clean, well-commented code
- Use AI tools effectively (we want to see this!)
- Ask clarifying questions
- Be authentic about your experience and interests

## Continuous Improvement

We regularly review our process based on:
- Candidate feedback

The goal is to keep evolving while maintaining our core principles of practical assessment and values alignment.
