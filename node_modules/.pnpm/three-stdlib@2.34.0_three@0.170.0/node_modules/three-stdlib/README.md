Stand-alone version of [threejs/examples/jsm](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples/jsm) written in Typescript & built for ESM & CJS.

## Basic usage

```bash
npm install three-stdlib
```

```ts
// Export collection
import * as STDLIB from 'three-stdlib'
// Flatbundle
import { OrbitControls, ... } from 'three-stdlib'
```

## Problem

`three/examples` are usually regarded as something that you copy/paste into your project and adapt to your needs. That's not how people use it, and this has caused numerous issues in the past.

## Solution

- A build system for ESM and CJS, compatible with browser, workers, and Node
- Class based, optimized for tree-shaking, no globals, exports instead of collections
- Typesafety with simple annotation-like types
- SemVer and NPM managed dependencies

But most importantly, allowing more people that use and rely on these primitives to hold a little stake, and to share the weight of maintaining it.

## How to Contribute

1.  Fork and clone the repo

4.  Let's get cooking! üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥ü•ì

Be sure your commit messages follow this specification: https://conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4

## Publishing

We use `semantic-release-action` to deploy the package. Because of this only certain commits will trigger the action of creating a release:

- `chore` will not release a new version
- `fix:` will create a `0.0.x` version
- `feat:` will create a `0.x.0` version
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` will create a `x.0.0` version
