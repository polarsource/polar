# Polar Python SDK

The official Python client for the [Polar API](https://polar.sh/docs/api-reference).

## Installation

The SDK requires Python 3.11 or later.

The SDK is currently available as a pre-release. To install it with `uv`:

```bash
uv add polar-sdk --prerelease allow
```

or, with `pip`:

```bash
pip install --pre polar-sdk
```

## Quick Start

Create an [organization access token](https://polar.sh/docs/integrate/oat) and use the client for
the current API version:

```python
from polar.v2026_04 import Polar

polar = Polar("polar_oat_xxx")

customer_state = polar.customers.get_state_external("customer_external_id")
print(customer_state)
```

### Async Client

Use `PolarAsync` in asynchronous applications:

```python
import asyncio

from polar.v2026_04 import PolarAsync


async def main() -> None:
    polar = PolarAsync("polar_oat_xxx")
    customer_state = await polar.customers.get_state_external("customer_external_id")
    print(customer_state)


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Context Managers

Both clients support context managers to close their HTTP connections automatically when the
block exits.

For synchronous applications, use `Polar` with `with`:

```python
from polar.v2026_04 import Polar

with Polar("polar_oat_xxx") as polar:
    customer_state = polar.customers.get_state_external("customer_external_id")
    print(customer_state)
```

For asynchronous applications, use `PolarAsync` with `async with`:

```python
import asyncio

from polar.v2026_04 import PolarAsync


async def main() -> None:
    async with PolarAsync("polar_oat_xxx") as polar:
        customer_state = await polar.customers.get_state_external(
            "customer_external_id"
        )
        print(customer_state)


asyncio.run(main())
```

The client uses the production environment by default. To use the sandbox, pass
`environment="sandbox"` when creating the client. Sandbox and production access tokens are
separate.

Keep organization access tokens on the server and never expose them in browser or client-side
code.

## Request Timeouts

Set the default timeout for all requests when creating the client. Timeout values are expressed
in seconds:

```python
polar = Polar("polar_oat_xxx", timeout=30)
```

Override the timeout for an individual request with `request_timeout`:

```python
customer_state = polar.customers.get_state_external(
    "customer_external_id",
    request_timeout=60,
)
```

Pass an `httpx.Timeout` instance to configure connect, read, write, and pool timeouts separately.

## Deserializing Data

Use `deserialize` to convert arbitrary data into a generated SDK model or union type:

```python
from polar import deserialize
from polar.v2026_04.outputs import Customer

customer = deserialize(data, Customer)
```

## Webhooks

Use `validate_event` to verify that a webhook was sent by Polar and parse it into a typed payload
for the selected API version. Pass the raw request body, the request headers, and your webhook
signing secret:

```python
import os

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Request

from polar.v2026_04.webhooks import (
    PolarWebhookError,
    PolarWebhookVerificationError,
    validate_event,
)

app = FastAPI()
webhook_secret = os.environ["POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET"]


@app.post("/webhooks/polar")
async def polar_webhook(request: Request) -> dict[str, bool]:
    try:
        event = validate_event(
            await request.body(),
            dict(request.headers),
            webhook_secret,
        )
    except PolarWebhookVerificationError as exc:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=403, detail="Invalid webhook signature"
        ) from exc
    except PolarWebhookError as exc:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid webhook payload") from exc

    if event.type == "order.created":
        print(event.data.id)

    return {"received": True}
```

The signature is checked before the body is parsed. Verification accepts Polar's
original HMAC key (UTF-8 bytes of the full secret, including `whsec_`) and the
Standard Webhooks key (base64-decode of the remainder after `whsec_`).
`validate_event` raises `PolarWebhookVerificationError` for invalid signatures and
`PolarWebhookUnknownTypeError` when the event is not supported by the selected API
version. Both inherit from `PolarWebhookError`.
